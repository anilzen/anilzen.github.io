&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="../../2023/waves-on-unbounded-domains">previous post&lt;/a>, I gave a technical guide on how to solve wave equations on unbounded domains. The example was simple: the homogeneous, one-dimensional wave equation. While that&amp;rsquo;s a nice little toy problem, it&amp;rsquo;s too simple. The general solution can be written down explicitly; you don&amp;rsquo;t need numerics to solve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is about a more interesting problem: &lt;em>gravitational waves from black holes&lt;/em>. This sounds cool, and it is. I&amp;rsquo;ll show you that computing gravitational waves is not that different from computing simple waves&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. All you need is an additional potential term. If you want to try it out, and numerically generate your own gravitational waves, you can run the code in Colab.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will compute gravitational waves propagating in the spacetime of a black hole by solving the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regge%E2%80%93Wheeler%E2%80%93Zerilli_equations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation&lt;/a> \eqref{1}.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="black-hole">Black hole&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, a little pedantry. In general relativity, a black hole is actually not a &amp;ldquo;thing.&amp;rdquo; You may hear that it&amp;rsquo;s a collapsed, dense star. This is how it forms but it&amp;rsquo;s not the right way to think about it in classical relativity. As far as we are concerned, the black hole is a &lt;em>boundary&lt;/em> of our domain&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. When I write about gravitational waves from a black hole, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that the black hole is waving. What&amp;rsquo;s waving is the spacetime &lt;em>around&lt;/em> the black hole. Avoid thinking of the black hole as &amp;ldquo;an object in space.&amp;rdquo; Instead, think of it as a &lt;em>boundary&lt;/em> of your domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A black hole is rigorously defined as the region of spacetime from which no signal can escape to the outside universe where we are. The “surface” of a black hole, called the event horizon, marks the boundary of that region. The black hole’s interior is no longer in causal contact with the external universe. It is literally not part of the manifold in which external physics takes place&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A black hole is not a hole in the usual sense&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and it&amp;rsquo;s not even black&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The simplest black hole solution to Einstein&amp;rsquo;s equations was discovered, amidst heavy &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/blogs/smithsonian-books/2025/03/13/the-man-who-helped-predict-black-holes-both-real-and-hypothetical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artillery fire&lt;/a> and freezing conditions, a few months after Einstein published his equations for gravity. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schwarzschild solution&lt;/a> (in Droste coordinates) is given by the metric
$$ ds^2 = - f(r) dt^2 + \frac{1}{f(r)} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2, $$
where $d\sigma^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \ d\phi^2$ is the metric on the unit sphere and
$$ f(r) = 1-\frac{2M}{r}, $$
with $M$ the mass of the black hole in natural units ($G=c=1$). Note how the function $f(r)$ vanishes at $r=2M$ leading to an apparently singular metric. This is the magic sphere (in Eddington&amp;rsquo;s words) that caused a lot of confusion in the early days of relativity. We now know that this singularity is an artefact of a bad choice of time. Our regular idea of time relies on the possibility of two-way synchronization. Such a construction is not possible at the event horizon because signals sent for synchronization inevitably vanish. We&amp;rsquo;ll fix this later; let&amp;rsquo;s first tickle this monster and see how it laughs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="banging">Banging&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We now perturb this spacetime&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> by adding a small scalar, electromagnetic, or gravitational field. Scalar fields are simplest to demonstrate the basic features of wave propagation in black hole spacetimes. Below is a simulation that I made a few years ago that shows what happens to such a scalar field when you bang the spacetime at a point some distance away from the black hole horizon&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We won&amp;rsquo;t perform a three-dimensional simulation, yet. To simplify the coding, we take advantage of the spherical symmetry of the black hole and decompose the scalar perturbation in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spherical harmonics&lt;/a>:
$$ U(t, r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} u_{\ell m}(t,r) Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi). $$
Each mode, $u_{\ell m}$, satisfies a one-dimensional equation that looks like this:
$$ \left(\partial_t^2 - \partial_{r_\ast}^2 + V_\ell(r_\ast) \right) u_{\ell m}(t, r_\ast) = S_{\ell m}(t,r_\ast). \tag{1}\label{1}$$
The coordinate $r_\ast$ is called the &lt;em>tortoise coordinate&lt;/em> and is defined by
$$ dr_\ast = \frac{dr}{f}, \quad \text{or} \quad \partial_{r_\ast} = f \partial_r.$$
Its domain is unbounded in both directions with $r_\ast\in(-\infty,\infty)$. A significant portion of research in black-hole perturbation theory consists in solving an equation of the type \eqref{1} for various potentials $V_\ell$ and sources $S_{\ell m}$. We&amp;rsquo;ll assume no sources for this post and omit the mode-dependence in the notation. In general, you can think of the perturbations sourced by particles representing, say, a stellar black hole orbiting in the spacetime of a galactic, supermassive black hole (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_mass_ratio_inspiral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme-mass-ratio inspiral&lt;/a>). Yes, you can indeed model crazy things with a simple equation like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can simply discretize and solve the equation \eqref{1} on a truncated domain but where&amp;rsquo;s the fun in that&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Let&amp;rsquo;s solve it on the full black-hole spacetime using hyperboloidal compactification. The general structure of the equation \eqref{1} is the same as the one-dimensional wave equation discussed &lt;a href="../../2023/waves-on-unbounded-domains/">previously&lt;/a>. The main difference is the potential term that can represent different types of perturbations. In this post, we want to calculate gravitational waves, so we use the &lt;em>gravitational&lt;/em> potential&lt;sup id="fnref:9">&lt;a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> given as a function of the areal coordinate $r$ as:
$$ V_{\ell}(r) = \frac{f(r)}{r^2} \left( \ell(\ell+1) - \frac{6M}{r} \right), \tag{2} \label{2} $$
where $\ell$ is the angular momentum number in the spherical harmonic decomposition. Note that the potential is given by the areal coordinate $r$ but the wave equation is written in the tortoise coordinate $r_\ast$. We&amp;rsquo;ll fix this problem in a little bit. Let&amp;rsquo;s first handle the unbounded domain in the tortoise coordinate $r_\ast$.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperboloidal-compactification">Hyperboloidal compactification&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To solve \eqref{1} on the infinite spacetime, we apply hyperboloidal compactification described in the &lt;a href="../../2023/waves-on-unbounded-domains">previous post&lt;/a>. The spatial compactification and the time transformation are
$$ \rho = \rho(r_\ast), \qquad \tau = t + h(r_\ast), $$
We define
$$ H_\ast(\rho):= \frac{dh}{dr_\ast}, \qquad G_\ast(\rho):= \frac{d\rho}{dr_\ast} = \left(\frac{d r_\ast}{d\rho}\right)^{-1}. $$
We write the wave equation \eqref{1} in symmetric hyperbolic form by defining auxiliary variables as before
$$ \psi := \partial_\rho u, \qquad \pi := \frac{1-H_\ast^2}{G_\ast} \partial_\tau u - H_\ast \partial_\rho u. $$
The wave equation \eqref{1} becomes first-order symmetric hyperbolic
$$
\begin{aligned}
\partial_\tau u
&amp;amp;= \frac{G_\ast}{1-H_\ast^2}\bigl(H_\ast \psi + \pi\bigr),\\[6pt]
\partial_\tau \psi
&amp;amp;= \partial_\rho \left[\frac{G_\ast}{1-H_\ast^2}\bigl(H_\ast\psi + \pi\bigr)\right],\\[6pt]
\partial_\tau \pi
&amp;amp;= \partial_\rho \left[\frac{G_\ast}{1-H_\ast^2}\bigl(\psi + H_\ast \pi\bigr)\right]
{\color{red}+ \frac{V_\ell}{G_\ast} u}.
\end{aligned}
\tag{3}\label{3}
$$
The only difference to the flat wave equation is the potential term in red. Since this is the main difference to the flat wave equation that allows us to compute gravitational waves from a black hole, let&amp;rsquo;s spend some time on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-gravitational-potential">The gravitational potential&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The asymptotic behavior of the potential \eqref{2} is determined by the factor $\frac{f}{r^2}$. The potential vanishes linearly at the event horizon and quadratically towards infinity. But by transforming to the tortoise coordinate we modify this behavior near the horizon because the tortoise coordinate diverges logarithmically as $r\to 2M$. Therefore, the potential \eqref{2}, or equivalently the term $\frac{f}{r^2}$, falls off exponentially toward the black-hole horizon and quadratically towards infinity in $r_\ast$. Below are two plots of the potential for $\ell=2$ and $M=\frac{1}{2}$, in $r$ and in $r_\ast$. The semilog plot in $r_\ast$ clearly shows the exponential decay on the left (near the horizon) and a quadratic decay on the right (toward infinity). The red dashed line marks the peak of the potential right outside the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photon sphere&lt;/a> around $r_p \approx 3.3 M$.&lt;/p>

One of the reasons people like the tortoise coordinate, aside from the resulting familiarity of the equation \eqref{1}, is that it naturally provides increased resolution in the strong field region near the horizon. You can see this clearly in the right plot where the domain $r_\ast&amp;lt;0$ has no sharp gradients. Let&amp;rsquo;s think about this a bit in our setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the compactified equation \eqref{3}, the gravitational potential is divided by the Jacobian $G_\ast$, which measures how the compactifying coordinate $\rho$ varies with the tortoise coordinate $r_\ast$. Since the infinite interval $r_\ast\in(-\infty, \infty)$ is mapped to a finite interval in $\rho$, we need $G_\ast\to 0$ at both ends. We must be careful that $G_\ast$ does not vanish faster than the potential for the ratio to be regular. Because the potential decays only quadratically towards infinity, we cannot use the exponential compactification from the &lt;a href="../../2023/waves-on-unbounded-domains">previous post&lt;/a>. In the exponential compactification, $G_\ast$ vanishes faster than $r^2$ grows and the potential term blows up. With $r_\ast = \mathrm{arctanh}(\rho)$ and $G_\ast=1-\rho^2$, and considering that asymptotically $r\sim r_\ast$, we get
$$ G_\ast\ r^2 \sim (1-\rho^2) \ \mathrm{arctanh}^2\rho \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad \rho\to 1. $$
The vanishing of $G_\ast r^2$ at infinity spoils regularity. Instead, we need an algebraic compactification. For example, something like $r_\ast = \tan\rho$ and $G_\ast=\cos^2\rho$, gives
$$ G_\ast\ r^2 \sim \cos^2\rho \ \tan^2\rho = \sin^2\rho = 1 \quad \text{as} \quad \rho\to \frac{\pi}{2}. $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a geometric reason for this restriction in compactification. As $r\to\infty$ the surface area of spheres grow quadratically. Therefore, only an algebraic compactification leads to a regular equation. When we use a compactification that&amp;rsquo;s too fast, the potential blows up. When the compactification behaves algebraically, such as a trigonometric function, the limit is regular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having figured this out, why do we use $r_\ast$ in the first place? I mentioned that it gives us additional resolution near the horizon, but we&amp;rsquo;re compactifying. We can adjust it to get the resolution we need without going through the tortoise coordinate. Let&amp;rsquo;s get rid of it and compute the potential explicitly in terms of a simpler transformation $r(\rho)$. We just need to be careful about the Jacobian:
$$ G_\ast = \frac{d\rho}{dr_\ast} = \frac{dr}{dr_\ast} \frac{d\rho}{dr} =: f G, $$
where we introduced $G:=d\rho/dr$. If we now consider $H_\ast$ also as a function of $r$ and transform directly to $\rho$, we can fully avoid the tortoise coordinate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are clearly many choices for the compactification. A simple one that I like is this:
$$ \frac{r}{2M} = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \quad \implies \quad G = \frac{(1-\rho)^2}{2M}. $$
This maps the domain $r\in(2M,\infty)$ to $\rho\in(1/2,1)$. We can numerically include the boundary points because they are regular after the time transformation. The potential term becomes
$$ \frac{V_\ell}{G_\ast} = \frac{V_\ell}{f G} = \frac{\ell(\ell+1)\rho - 3(1-\rho)}{2M \rho^3}. $$
And the plot for $\ell=2, M=1$ is below.

This is &lt;em>beautiful!&lt;/em> Note that the compactification cancels the redshift factor $f$ from the original RWZ potential. As a consequence, the peak of the &lt;em>rescaled&lt;/em> potential is at the horizon, and it monotonically decreases from the strong field region towards infinity. We&amp;rsquo;ll have no problem solving equations with such a simple term.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="time-transformation">Time transformation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The final remaining ingredient for our system \eqref{3} is the boost $H_\ast$. Again, there are many choices. Arguably, the simplest choice that bridges the horizon and infinity is the &lt;a href="https://hyperboloid.al/post/minimal-gauge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimal gauge&lt;/a>. You can derive it by just requiring the proper behavior at both boundaries and regularity at infinity. Consider the $(t,r_\ast)$ block of the Schwarzschild metric:
$$ ds^2_{t,r_\ast} = f \left(-dt^2 +dr_\ast^2\right). $$
In- and outgoing null rays of this metric are $v=t+r_\ast$ and $u=t-r_\ast$. We want the coordinate $\tau$ to behave as $v$ toward the horizon, and as $u$ towards infinity. This implies $H_\ast\to 1$ as $r\to 2M$ and $H_\ast\to -1$ as $r\to\infty$. Further, we want conformal regularity at infinity for the transformed metric:
$$ ds^2_{\tau,r_\ast} = f \left(-d\tau^2 + 2 H d\tau dr_\ast + (1-H_\ast^2) dr_\ast^2\right). $$
Conformal regularity means a finite limit for $\Omega^2 ds^2$ when $\Omega=0$. Since $\Omega\sim r^{-1}$, we must satisfy as $r\to\infty$:
$$ 1-H_\ast^2 = (1-H_\ast) (1 + H_\ast) \sim \frac{1}{r^2}, $$
which means
$$H_\ast \sim -1 + \frac{C}{r^2}, $$
as $r\to\infty$. These conditions are true for all time transformations bridging between the future event horizon and future null infinity. By taking only the leading term above, and imposing the requirement $H_\ast(r=2M)=1$ gives us the boost function for the minimal gauge:
$$ H_\ast = -1 + \frac{8M^2}{r^2}. $$
In our compactifying coordinate $\rho$, the term that ensures the regularity of the compactified equation reads:
$$ \frac{fG}{1-H_\ast^2} = \frac{\rho^3}{8M}.$$
The minimal gauge leads to particularly simple expresions for the transformed system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-numerical-solution">The numerical solution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s wrap up. The choices for the compactification and time transformation above give us the following system
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\partial_\tau u
&amp;amp;= \frac{\rho^{3}}{8M}\bigl(H_\ast\psi + \pi\bigr),\\[4pt]
\partial_\tau \psi
&amp;amp;= \partial_\rho\left[\frac{\rho^{3}}{8M}\bigl(H_\ast\psi + \pi\bigr)\right],\\[4pt]
\partial_\tau \pi
&amp;amp;= \partial_\rho\left[\frac{\rho^{3}}{8M}\bigl(\psi + H_\ast\pi\bigr)\right]
+\frac{\ell(\ell+1)\rho - 3(1-\rho)}{2M\rho^{3}}u,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
H_\ast
= -1+\frac{8M^2}{r(\rho)^2}
= -1 + \frac{2}{\rho^2}(1-\rho)^2
\end{equation}
The system doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any boundary data by construction. We simply apply one-sided stencils at the boundaries as before. All we need now is to prescribe some initial data (typically a localized Gaussian) and run the &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ii9zyHE9MlaOW4e9K1IBGPSPQzxltO7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solver&lt;/a>. The simulation in Colab takes about 30 seconds for $1000M$. I also included a different gauge condition based on constant mean curvature foliations (CMC) that&amp;rsquo;s almost 4 times faster&lt;sup id="fnref:10">&lt;a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. For this case, the boost function is only slightly more complicated
$$
H^{CMC}_\ast = - \frac{J}{\sqrt{J^2+f r^4}}, \quad J = \frac{K r^3}{3}-C,
$$
with parameters $K$ and $C$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Either case, you get a gravitational wave signal that looks like this at infinity:

&lt;p>Why infinity? Infinity is the correct model for the wave signal because we observe gravitational waves from black holes that are hundreds of millions of light years away. That&amp;rsquo;s far. Very far. Mathematically, we model such distances by infinity, which we have wisely mapped to the outer boundary of our numerical domain. We&amp;rsquo;ve done it for technical reasons (to avoid numerical reflections, artificial truncation, to improve efficiency, etc.) but there are physical reasons why we&amp;rsquo;re interested in the data at infinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you see in the signal above is a typical time evolution of a black-hole perturbation divided into three distinct phases: prompt response, exponential ringdown, and polynomial tail. This behavior has been studied for over half a century by now, yet we keep discovering new phenomena in the black-hole&amp;rsquo;s response to perturbations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The prompt response is a transient phase triggered by the specifics of the perturbation. We used to discard this part because it depends on the initial data, but in the last 5 years or so there has been more attention to this piece in order to get a handle of the complete picture (see, for example, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2601.11706&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ringdown is when the spacetime oscillates at a frequency that only depends on intrinsic properties of the black hole&amp;mdash;in our case the mass. These characteristic modes are called quasinormal modes (QNMs). Intuitively, the energy from the perturbation absorbed by the black hole and escapes to infinity. Some of the energy that goes toward the black hole gets trapped by the photon sphere. This part becomes exponentially weaker with each cycle (see the above YouTube video) which we measure as QNM ringing. The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physics/articles/10.3389/fphy.2024.1497601/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperboloidal approach to QNMs&lt;/a> has uncovered phenomena such as the &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.11.031003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pseudospectral instability&lt;/a> that are active areas of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The part that escapes to infinity scatters off of the background curvature on its way and that scattered piece decays polynomially. It&amp;rsquo;s very weak, so it becomes only visible after the exponential ringdown becomes smaller than the polynomially decaying part. This part is also being studied currently, specifically the &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/2brx-xnyr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonlinear tails&lt;/a>. The plot on the right below shows the decay rates for observers at different distances from the black hole. For the $\ell=2$ perturbation, the infinity signal decays as $t^{-4}$ whereas the finite distance signal decays as $t^{-7}$.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- To evaluate the potential, we need to understand the tortoise coordinate and compute $r(r_\ast)$.
### The tortoise coordinate
The tortoise coordinate is useful because it simplifies the expression describing how disturbances propagate. The Schwarzschild metric in the tortoise coordinate becomes
$$ ds^2 = - f(r_\ast) \left(dt^2 + dr_\ast^2\right) + r^2 d\sigma^2, $$
Note that this is independent of the form of $f(r)$. Tortoise coordinates are useful for practically all spherically symmetric spacetimes, including those that describe metrics for alternative theories. Perturbations propagate as functions of $t \pm r_\ast$ which is why equation \eqref{1} looks so familiar in this coordinate[^chars].
In the Schwarzschild case, we can write down the tortoise coordinate explicitly in terms of the areal coordinate[^constant]
$$ r_\ast = \int \frac{dr}{f(r)} = \int \left(1+ \frac{2M}{r-2M}\right) dr = r + 2M \log\left|\frac{r}{2M}-1\right|. $$
The exterior domain of the Schwarzschild black hole, $r\in(2M,\infty)$, is mapped to $r_\ast\in(-\infty,\infty)$. We're in luck because we already know how to deal with such unbounded domains. Though, we'll see that the three dimensional space of an asymptotically flat spacetime wants a slightly different compactification than what we used before.
We need the inverse relationship that connects the areal coordinate $r$ to the tortoise coordinate $r_\ast$ because the potential $V_\ell(r)$ is given in terms of $r$ but our grid is given in $r_\ast$. Let's restrict ourselves to the exterior domain with $r>2M$ for simplicity. First we get rid of the logarithm by exponentiation
$$ e^{\frac{r_\ast}{2M}} = e^{\frac{r}{2M}} \left(\frac{r}{2M}-1\right). $$
We can solve this using the [Lambert W function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function) which solves the equation $x = e^y y$ as $y(x) = W(x)$. By comparing with the equation above, we set $y=\frac{r}{2M}-1$ and $x=e^{\frac{r_\ast}{2M}-1}$. We conclude that the inverse relationship is[^branches]
$$ \frac{r}{2M} = 1 + W\left(e^{\frac{r_\ast}{2M}-1}\right). $$
The Lambert W function is implemented in the scipy package, so we define the inverse relationship in Python as follows:
```python
from scipy.special import lambertw
def r_ast_to_r(r_ast):
return 2*M*(1+lambertw(np.exp(r_ast/(2*M)-1)).real)
```
When the input becomes very large, which happens because we compactify space, this function becomes inaccurate. There's a trick to deal with this problem. Instead of first taking the exponential and then taking the Lambert W, we use the asymptotic expansion.
$$ W(x) \sim \ln x - \ln \ln x + \dots \quad \text{as} \quad x\to\infty. $$
For large values of $r_\ast$, we write the inverse relationship as
$$ \frac{r}{2M} \sim \frac{r_\ast}{2M} - \ln \left(\frac{r_\ast}{2M}-1\right) + \dots. $$
We can add more terms into the expansion to make it more accurate. For now, the take away is that we can compute $r$ from $r_\ast$ and they approach each other asymptotically as $r_\ast\to\infty$. -->

&lt;p>Strictly speaking this is only true for linear perturbations. The full problem requires solving the Einstein equations, which is much harder, both technically and conceptually.

First of all, truncation implies that you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the solution &lt;em>at&lt;/em> the horizon or &lt;em>at&lt;/em> the observer. The horizon and observer signals must be extrapolated from the truncated solution, which can get messy. In addition, truncated boundaries typically cause artificial reflections.

&lt;h2 id="why-waves">Why waves?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our most important senses, sight and sound, rely on waves. Electromagnetic and acoustic waves carry information from an external reality far from the immediate neighborhood of our body to our audiovisual system. Our current understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe is based on waves. Quantum field theory models all elementary particles as wave-like excitations of quantum fields. Most remarkably, we have recently gained the ability to detect gravitational waves, or spacetime waves, from the most energetic phenomena in the Universe happening billions of light years away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ability to understand waves by solving the equations that describe them is essential also for practical applications, such as modeling of earthquakes (seismology), ocean waves and tsunamis (oceanography), sonar systems (acoustics), radar scattering off airplanes and antenna design (electromagnetism), among others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t need that motivation if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-mathematical-model">The mathematical model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The simplest equation that describes a wave is aptly named the wave equation. We&amp;rsquo;ll consider the case with one space dimension
$$ \left(-\partial_t^2 + \partial_x^2\right) u(x,t) = 0. \tag{1} \label{1}$$
The acceleration (or curvature in time), $\partial_t^2$, is bced by the curvature in space, $\partial_x^2$. This delicate balance leads to solutions that propagate while maintaining their form. In one dimension, there are only two directions a wave can propagate, and we get the general solution
$$ u(x,t) = f_+(x-t) + f_-(x+t). $$
The functions $f_\pm$ travel unchanged along the curves $x\pm t$. We call these curves &lt;em>characteristics&lt;/em>. The characteristics extend infinitely in both directions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We solved \eqref{1} explicitly, but more interesting wave equations cannot be solved like this. They include higher dimensions, varying coefficients, potential terms, source functions, nonlinearities, etc. For those cases, we use numerical methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there&amp;rsquo;s a problem. The wave equation is posed on a spatially unbounded domain, $x\in(-\infty, \infty)$&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Before we can solve the equation numerically, we need to decide what to do with the unbounded domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-boundaries">Why boundaries?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An argument that one finds in some textbooks and papers is that computational resources are finite, so we must truncate the solution domain artificially to some $x\in(-L, L)$ with $L$ suitably large. We then apply boundary conditions to the solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This artificial truncation creates two problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>boundary treatment, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>radiation extraction.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The construction of boundary conditions for wave equations has been its own research direction since the 1970s, with thousands of papers written on the problem. The corresponding conditions have names such as absorbing, transparent, non-reflecting, or radiative&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Due to the difficulty of the problem, people also constructed damping layers, which are not boundary conditions but layers of artificial dissipation that absorb the wave, such as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfectly matched layer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even when you have a somewhat satisfactory treatment of the boundary, you still don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the full solution. The full solution, however, is relevant when you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the radiative fields that are defined at infinity. Whether you want to calculate radar cross-sections of airplanes or gravitational waves from black holes, you need to know the solution at infinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then why don&amp;rsquo;t we solve the full problem on the full domain? The argument of finite computational resources is clearly wrong. We can map the unbounded domain to a bounded domain. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="spatial-compactification">Spatial compactification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many options to map the infinite domain $x\in(-\infty,\infty)$ to a finite domain in some other coordinate, $\rho$. A well-known option is the tangens function: $x = \tan \rho$ with $\rho\in[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. You can also perform an algebraic compactification, $x=\rho/(1-\rho^2)$, or use the hyperbolic tangent, $x=\mathrm{arctanh}\ \rho$ with $\rho\in[-1,1]$. The basic idea is to map the infinite domain $x$ to a compact domain in $\rho$ and then solve the wave equation numerically on this finite, compact domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It sounds obvious and, indeed, has been tried in the 1970s&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The problem is that solutions oscillate out to infinity. The spatial mapping converts an unbounded domain problem to an unbounded oscillation problem, and we gain nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider a sine-wave solution to the wave equation, $u(x,t) = \sin(x-t)$. If you compactify using the hyperbolic tangent, you get $u(\rho,t) = \sin(\mathrm{arctanh}\ \rho-t)$ which has infinite frequency at the boundaries. We can&amp;rsquo;t even plot the function, let alone solve for it numerically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the level of the wave equation, the propagating wave slows down as it approaches the boundary of the compactified domain, where its propagation speed vanishes. With $\partial_x = (1-\rho^2) \partial_\rho$, we get for Eq. \eqref{1}
$$ \left[-\partial_t^2 + (1-\rho^2)^2 \partial_\rho^2 + 2 \rho (1-\rho^2) \partial_\rho \right] u(\rho,t) = 0. $$
The speed of the wave is now $c_\pm = \pm (1-\rho^2)$. Both speeds vanish at both boundaries, which implies that the outgoing characteristics get stuck. The characteristics are $x\pm t = \mathrm{arctanh} \ \rho \pm t$ plotted below.

Outgoing characteristics pile up near the boundaries when one performs only a spatial compactification. Radiative fields cannot be resolved numerically near the domain boundaries.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see that the outgoing characteristics pile up near the boundary (blue on the left; green on the right). This slowing down of waves near the boundary makes intuitive sense. The original wave has a constant speed and cannot reach infinity at a finite time. Therefore, the wave gets slower on the mapped domain while its wavelength becomes shorter until we cannot resolve it anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, waves cannot propagate to infinity when we compactify an infinite mathematical domain to a finite numerical domain. They get stuck and blueshifted. We then conclude that spatial compactification is not useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unless, maybe, we&amp;rsquo;re missing something.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="time-transformation">Time transformation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The one-dimensional wave equation \eqref{1} was first written by d&amp;rsquo;Alembert in 1747, looong before we had any inkling that &amp;ldquo;space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Remarkably, the wave equation enforcing balance between curvature in time and curvature in space seems to know about spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we miss when we only consider spatial compactification is that the wave equation is a &lt;em>spacetime&lt;/em> equation. We must transform time as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the outgoing sine wave again. The reason for the infinite frequency problem was that the characteristics blew up near the boundaries.
Using $\mathrm{arctanh}\ \rho = \frac{1}{2} (\ln (1+\rho) - \ln(1-\rho))$, we can catch the problematic logarithms near $\rho=\pm 1$ by defining a new time coordinate $\tau$ such that&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
$$ \tau = t + \frac{1}{2} \ln (1-\rho^2).$$
Now, the characteristics are given by
$$ x\pm t = \mp \ln(1\mp \rho) \pm \tau. $$
This behavior is the one we need: only outgoing, no incoming characteristics at both boundaries.&lt;/p>

Outgoing characteristics leave the simulation domain through the boundaries when one combines spatial compactification with a suitable time transformation. Radiative fields can be read off at infinity.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the wave equation, consider the transformation of the differential operators
$$ \partial_t = \partial_\tau, \qquad \partial_x = - \rho \ \partial_\tau\ + (1-\rho^2) \ \partial_\rho. $$
The wave equation becomes&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- $$ \left(-\partial_\tau^2 - 2\sin\rho\ \partial_\tau \partial_\rho + \cos^2\rho\ \partial_\rho^2 + \cos\rho\ \partial_\tau - 2 \cos\rho \sin\rho \ \partial_\rho \right) u(\rho,\tau) = 0. $$ -->
&lt;p>$$ \left(-\partial_\tau^2 - 2 \rho\ \partial_\tau \partial_\rho + (1-\rho^2) \partial_\rho^2 - \partial_\tau - 2 \rho \ \partial_\rho \right) u(\rho,\tau) = 0. \tag{2}\label{2} $$
It looks a bit more complicated than \eqref{1}, but now you can solve the equation numerically on the &lt;em>entire&lt;/em> domain! Below is the dynamical solution for Gaussian initial data.

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The waves leave the spacetime smoothly through the outer boundaries, which correspond to the two infinities at either side. The solution at these boundaries is the radiative field. No extrapolation is necessary! Combining the spatial compactification with a suitable time transformation solved both the boundary and the radiation problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The time transformation that we used is not unique. There are many other options. These time functions are called &lt;em>hyperboloidal&lt;/em>. Below is the generalization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hyperboloidal-compactification">Hyperboloidal compactification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hyperboloidal compactification consists of a spatial compactification
$$ \rho = g(x), $$
together with a suitable time transformation
$$ \tau = t + h(x), $$
To see what &lt;em>suitable&lt;/em> means here, let&amp;rsquo;s define
$$ H:= \frac{dh}{dx}, \qquad G:= \frac{dg}{dx}. $$
As a compactification, $G$ vanishes at the boundaries. The wave equation becomes after a division by $G$
$$ \left(-\frac{1-H^2}{G} \partial_\tau^2 + 2 H \partial_\tau \partial_\rho + G \partial_\rho^2 + H&amp;rsquo; \partial_\tau + G&amp;rsquo;\partial_\rho \right) u(\rho,\tau) = 0. $$
For this equation to be regular, we require $1-H^2 \sim G$ at the boundaries, which means $|H|\sim 1$ at the leading order. We also want $|H|&amp;lt;1$ away from the boundaries to keep the principal part intact&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. This is the hyperboloidal compactification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To solve the hyperboloidal wave equation \eqref{2}, we can write it in symmetric hyperbolic form. We define the auxiliary variables
$$ \psi := \partial_\rho u, \qquad \pi := \frac{1-H^2}{G} \partial_\tau u - H \partial_\rho u. $$
The full system reads
$$\partial_\tau \pi = \partial_\rho \left[\frac{G}{1-H^2} ( \psi + H \pi ) \right], $$
$$\partial_\tau \psi = \partial_\rho \left[\frac{G}{1-H^2} (H\psi + \pi )\right],$$
$$ \partial_\tau u = \frac{G}{1-H^2} (H \psi + \pi).$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system is symmetric. Hyperbolicity follows from the properties of $H$ and $G$. For the case that we discussed above, we have
$$ \rho = \tanh x, \qquad \tau = t - \ln(\cosh x) = t + \frac{1}{2} \ln (1-\rho^2). $$
The functions $G$ and $H$ are
$$ G = 1-\rho^2, \quad H = -\rho \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{G}{1-H^2} = 1. $$
The equation becomes very simple
$$\partial_\tau \pi = \partial_\rho \left( \psi - \rho \ \pi \right),$$
$$\partial_\tau \psi = \partial_\rho \left(- \rho\ \psi + \pi \right), \tag{3}\label{3}$$
$$\partial_\tau u = (-\rho\ \psi + \pi).$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, we solve this equation numerically.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="numerical-implementation">Numerical implementation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I picked a simple method that&amp;rsquo;s relatively accurate: 4th-order finite differences in space and 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration in time. The finite difference operators are one-sided at the boundaries.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We discussed the simplest example of a wave equation. You may wonder about the wider applicability of this method. It has been applied in higher dimensions with varying coefficients, potential terms, source functions, and nonlinearities. I might write about black-hole perturbations in a future post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this technique is relatively well-known in relativity, it&amp;rsquo;s not used at all in other fields where wave propagation is relevant. It would be fascinating to see this relativistic method applied to a non-relativistic problem, such as the propagation of acoustic waves or the computation of radar cross-sections.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Even when the physical domain is not unbounded, infinity may be a better model than a large distance because the relevant wavelengths are small compared to the domain size. I argued this point in another blog post: &lt;a href="../empirical-infinity">How far is infinity?&lt;/a>&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;li id="fn:2">
&lt;p>There is a reason for these different names. The main goal of the boundary condition is that the solution doesn&amp;rsquo;t see the boundary. In higher dimensions, boundary conditions typically lead to artificial reflections for waves that hit the boundary at an incidence angle. Therefore, the data should be absorbing or non-reflective. But that&amp;rsquo;s not sufficient for equations with a potential term or nonlinearities because there is scattering all the way to infinity and simply absorbing the wave is not faithful to the actual solution. Note that we also distinguish between boundary &lt;em>conditions&lt;/em> that should lead to a well-posed initial-boundary problem and boundary &lt;em>data&lt;/em> that should lead to the transparency of the artificial boundary. After decades of research and thousands of papers, there is no &lt;em>local and exact&lt;/em> solution to the unbounded domain problem other than compactification.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Strictly speaking, the mapping is only valid for $\rho\in(-\pi/2,\pi/2)$, which is an open interval and therefore not compact. Compactification extends space by adding the limit points to the domain. This is a subtle process that assumes a certain behavior of mathematical objects in space, but for this post, think of it as adding the points at infinity $\{-1\}$ and
$\{1\}$ to the open interval $(-1,1)$ to make it compact. The reason we can do this has to do with the asymptotic properties of wave equations.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Misner&lt;/a> passed on July 24, 2023, and there was a lovely &lt;a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/events/misnersymposium.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memorial symposium&lt;/a> at the University of Maryland on November 11, 2023, to celebrate his life. Misner was a prolific scientist who significantly influenced the early developments of general relativity during its first &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_general_relativity#Golden_age" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golden age&lt;/a>. His last three submissions on the arXiv are on hyperboloidal compactification, a rather niche topic in relativity that happens to be my research area, so I wrote this post about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The symposium gave an excellent overview of Misner&amp;rsquo;s work and provided some insight into his character. Misner is most widely known as the &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation_%28book%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MTW&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM_formalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADM&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. One cannot possibly discuss every topic that Misner influenced in a single day, so, inevitably, some of his research areas were left out; among them was his work on hyperboloidal methods. Below are Misner&amp;rsquo;s last three submissions on the arXiv.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0409073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperboloidal Slices and Artificial Cosmology for Numerical Relativity&lt;/a> (2004) published as part of &lt;a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/5688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deserfest&lt;/a>,&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Misner&amp;rsquo;s main idea is to add an artificial cosmological constant to the Einstein equations to help with hyperboloidal compactification. Below, I will discuss his idea in two sections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the &lt;a href="#the-coordinates">coordinates&lt;/a>. Misner proposes a hyperboloidal compactification in the toy model of de Sitter spacetime to demonstrate his idea. The coordinates he proposes are, in my opinion, not particularly useful. We now have a good understanding of hyperboloidal compactification that wasn&amp;rsquo;t available then. I will discuss his coordinates based on our current understanding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the &lt;a href="#artificial-cosmological-constant">artificial cosmological constant&lt;/a>. Misner proposes to modify the Einstein equations with a small cosmological constant to stabilize hyperboloidal evolution. This is a very interesting and promising idea that, to my knowledge, has never been tried before.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-coordinates">The coordinates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The main construction is clearly laid out in Misner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0409073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first paper&lt;/a> prepared for the celebration of his long-time collaborator &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Deser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stanley Deser&lt;/a>. The other papers are commentary, demonstration, and further development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before discussing the coordinates, we&amp;rsquo;ll review our current understanding of hyperboloidal regularization of coordinate singularities to put Misner&amp;rsquo;s construction in context.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="spacelike-regularizationof-coordinate-singularities">Spacelike regularization of coordinate singularities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Take a spherically symmetric, stationary spacetime. For brevity, we&amp;rsquo;ll ignore the spherical part of the spacetime and discuss only the $\{t,r\}$ plane. We write the metric as
$$ ds^2 = - f(r) dt^2 + \frac{1}{f(r)} dr^2. $$
We get Minkowski with $f=1$, Schwarzschild with $f=1-\frac{2M}{r}$, or de Sitter with $ f = 1-\frac{r^2}{L^2}$. There&amp;rsquo;s a (coordinate) singularity where $f$ vanishes: the event horizon of Schwarzschild at $r=2M$ or the cosmological horizon of de Sitter at $r=L$. From the conformal point of view, spatial infinity is also a coordinate singularity, but it&amp;rsquo;s not visible on the metric without compactification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After decades of confusion following Schwarzschild&amp;rsquo;s first publication of the Schwarzschild metric, we now know that a suitable re-slicing of spacetime (a different definition of time) resolves such coordinate singularities. There are many different ways to do this, but, especially for numerics, we&amp;rsquo;d like to maintain the time symmetry of the background when introducing a new time function. Otherwise, the coefficients of the transformed metric depend on time. The time symmetry is respected by transformations of the form
$$ \tau = t + h(r).$$
The function $h(r)$ is called the height function because it describes the height of the new coordinate $\tau$ with respect to $t$ when plotted on the $\{t,r\}$ plane. This transformation leaves the time derivatives invariant as intended: $\partial_t = \partial_\tau$. The metric becomes
$$ ds^2 = - f d\tau^2 + 2 f H \ d\tau dr + \frac{1-f^2 H^2}{f} dr^2, $$
where we have defined $H:=dh/dr$. Regularization refers to choosing a suitable $H$ such that the $rr$-component of the above metric is regular at the zeros of $f$. This requirement implies $fH \sim \pm 1$ at those zeros. Spacelike regularization ensures that $\tau$ is a time coordinate with spacelike level sets, which implies $|fH|&amp;lt;1$ away from the zeros of $f$. The sign of $H$ determines the orientation with respect to the null cone: whether we resolve the white hole or the black hole, past null infinity or future null infinity. If you compare the time transformation above with the null coordinates, $u=t-r$ and $v=t+r$, you can see that the slicing resembles outgoing null rays, $u$, for $H&amp;lt;0$ and ingoing null rays, $v$, for $H&amp;gt;0$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hyperboloidal coordinates provide a spacelike regularization of the coordinate singularity for the conformal metric at spatial infinity. The name &amp;ldquo;hyperboloidal&amp;rdquo; comes from the asymptotic similarity of this construction to the behavior of standard hyperboloids in suitable coordinates:
$$\tau = t - \sqrt{1+r^2}. \tag{1} \label{1} $$
To see that this is a hyperboloid, think of it as $(\tau-t)^2 - r^2 = 1$. For large $r$, the hyperboloidal coordinate $\tau$ approaches the null coordinate $u$ but has spacelike level sets everywhere. The defining property of hyperboloidal coordinates is the spacelike regularization of coordinate singularities at null horizons. I wrote more about this in the context of &lt;a href="https://anilzen.github.io/post/hyperbolic-relativity/">hyperbolic geometry for special relativity&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://anilzen.github.io/post/2023/splitting-spacetime/">splitting spacetime into space and time&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In asymptotically flat spacetimes, hyperboloidal regularization allows us to fix future null infinity&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> at a constant spatial coordinate (&lt;a href="../../../publication/zenginoglu-2008-hyperboloidal/">scri-fixing&lt;/a>). In black hole spacetimes, spacelike regularization leads to horizon-penetrating coordinates crucial for the excision of black hole interiors. In cosmological spacetimes, it allows us to perform numerical simulations, including the cosmological horizon. The cosmological case is what Misner discusses in his papers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="de-sitter-spacetime">de Sitter spacetime&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We get de Sitter spacetime with&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
$$ f = 1 - \frac{r^2}{L^2}. $$
As mentioned above, there is a coordinate singularity at the cosmological horizon, $r=L$, where $f$ vanishes. The hallmark of the coordinate singularity is intersecting time slices in the conformal diagram&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We want to construct a regularization of the future cosmological horizon. The null cone structure is given by $u=t-r_\ast$ and $v=t+r_\ast$ with $r_\ast = \int \frac{dr}{f} = L \ \mathrm{archtanh }\ \frac{r}{L}$. We are primarily interested in the domain up to the cosmological horizon, $r\leq L$. Here&amp;rsquo;s a suitable choice that satisfies our two requirements ($fH \to - 1$ as $r\to L$ and $|fH|&amp;lt;1$ for $r&amp;lt;L$):
$$ f H = - \frac{r^2}{L^2}.$$
By integration, we get the new time coordinate
$$\tau = t + r - L \ \mathrm{archtanh }\ \frac{r}{L}.$$
The metric becomes
$$ ds^2 = - f d\tau^2 - \frac{2 r^2}{L^2} d\tau dr + \left(1+\frac{r^2}{L^2}\right) dr^2. $$
This metric is particularly nice because it can be written in Kerr-Schild form&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> as the sum of the Minkowski metric and a scaled null field
$$ ds^2 = - d\tau^2 + dr^2 + \frac{r^2}{L^2} \left(d\tau - dr\right)^2. $$
The singularity at the cosmological horizon $r=L$ is resolved. This construction allows us to perform numerical calculations including the cosmological horizon. The time slices resolve the coordinate singularity in the previous conformal diagram. Instead, we obtain a smooth foliation of the cosmological horizon, as seen below. The diagram also demonstrates that Kerr-Schild coordinates beyond the horizon resemble trumpet slices in black hole spacetimes.&lt;/p>

Kerr-Schild slicing provides a hyperboloidal foliation of the cosmological horizon. The slices approach timelike infinity beyond the horizon resembling trumpet slices in black-hole spacetimes.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Misner takes the Kerr-Schild form of the de Sitter metric as a starting point and adds another time transformation
$$ T = \tau - \sqrt{1+r^2}. $$
This is what he calls hyperboloidal. The transformation is formally that of the standard hyperboloid as in Eq. \eqref{1}, but applying this in the geometry of de Sitter spacetime is awkward. The point of the standard hyperboloid is that asymptotically in Minkowski spacetime (for large $r$), the transformed time coordinate approaches the outgoing null cone: $T\sim t - r$. However, the outgoing null cone in de Sitter spacetime does not have this form; therefore, the transformation is not hyperboloidal with respect to the actual background. As the time transformation doesn&amp;rsquo;t respect the underlying causal structure of de Sitter spacetime, it does nothing to regularize an already regular coordinate system. Nevertheless, let&amp;rsquo;s write down the metric
$$ ds^2 = -f dT^2 - 2 \left( \frac{r}{L^2} + \frac{f}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} \right) dT dr $$
$$ + \frac{L^2 + r^2 + 2 r^4 - 2r^3\sqrt{1+r^2}}{L^2 (1+r^2)} dr^2. $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only impact of this transformation on the asymptotic behavior of the time slices is when $L=1$ or when the coefficient of $r$ in the hyperboloid matches the cosmological radius. In this case, the time slices end at future spacelike null infinity, $\mathscr I^+$, instead of future timelike infinity, $i^+$.

Misner slicing also provides a hyperboloidal foliation of the cosmological horizon. The main difference to the Kerr-Schild slicing is that, beyond the horizon, the slices hit $\mathscr I^+$ when $L=1$.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, Misner introduces the spatial compactification
$$ r = \frac{\rho}{1-\left(\frac{\rho}{2}\right)^2}. $$
Remember that future null infinity, $\mathscr I^+$, is spacelike in cosmological spacetimes. The compactification maps $\mathscr I^+$ to $\rho=2$. But no compactification is needed if we&amp;rsquo;re interested in the cosmological horizon, which is at a finite distance. One can consider $r$ already as a compactification of the tortoise coordinate $r_*$. In the case of de Sitter, the cosmological horizon at $r=L$ acts as the ingoing null surface representing a far-away observer. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to access spacelike null infinity, so the compactification seems unnecessary. Compactification might be useful for very large $L$, but even then, what we need is not necessarily a compactification but a mapping of the cosmological horizon to a coordinate sphere whose location is independent of the cosmological constant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all I have to say about the coordinates. There are better choices if you want to evolve fields accurately in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. But Misner&amp;rsquo;s goal is not to evolve fields on the background of asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. He aims to evolve the Einstein equations to construct astrophysically relevant asymptotically flat spacetimes using an &lt;em>artificial&lt;/em> cosmological constant. And that&amp;rsquo;s a very promising idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="artificial-cosmological-constant">Artificial cosmological constant&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s say we are interested in solving the Einstein equations for gravitational waves propagating large distances along outgoing null geodesics, all the way up to and including future null scri. To include scri, we solve the equations for a conformally rescaled metric $g= \Omega^2 \tilde{g}$ following &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.10.66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Penrose&lt;/a>. The conformal Einstein equations read
$$ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R = T_{\mu\nu}[\Omega], $$
with conformal source terms
$$ T[\Omega] = -\frac{2}{ {\color{darkred}\Omega}} \left(\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \Omega - \Box \Omega g_{\mu\nu}\right) - \frac{3}{ {\color{darkred}\Omega^2} } \nabla_\lambda \Omega \nabla^\lambda \Omega g_{\mu\nu}. $$
The conformal factor vanishes at future null infinity which is a subset of the conformal boundary of spacetime where $\Omega=0$. If we want to include the conformal boundary in our numerical computations, we must somehow deal with the formal singularity of these terms at $\Omega=0$. I write &amp;ldquo;formal singularity&amp;rdquo; because one can show that the terms are regular under reasonable assumptions. However, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to impose that regularity on hyperboloidal surfaces while keeping the evolution numerically stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Misner&amp;rsquo;s idea is to add a small cosmological term to the equations
$$ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R {\color{darkgreen} - \frac{3}{L^2 \Omega^2} g_{\mu\nu}} = T_{\mu\nu}[\Omega]. $$
For large $L$, this term can be as small as we want as long as $\Omega&amp;gt;0$. However, the global causal structure of spacetime is dramatically different at $\Omega=0$. Null infinity is not a null surface anymore; it&amp;rsquo;s a spacelike surface! Even the definition of gravitational radiation becomes difficult and is an &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing research topic&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Misner&amp;rsquo;s insight is that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to evolve the fields until the conformal boundary. It&amp;rsquo;s sufficient to go slightly beyond the cosmological horizon and stop at a spacelike surface. In Misner&amp;rsquo;s approach, &lt;strong>the conformal factor does not vanish anywhere on the grid&lt;/strong>! This method mimics the excision method inside a black-hole (apparent) horizon. For large $L$, the resulting radiation field should match the radiation field in the asymptotically flat case. We consider the cosmological constant an artificial term, a numerical trick, allowing us to apply excision beyond the cosmological horizon. This is the core idea of Misner&amp;rsquo;s approach: excise the unobservable universe beyond the cosmological horizon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="potential-advantages">Potential advantages&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Theoretically, this approach provides all the benefits of hyperboloidal compactification: improved efficiency, no artificial boundary conditions, and no radiation extrapolation problem. In addition, one can expect improved stability due to the artificial cosmological constant. There are some caveats that I&amp;rsquo;ll mention; I think they are manageable in practical numerical work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="efficiency">Efficiency&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In the asymptotically flat scenario, the numerical efficiency comes from the time transformation that stretches the spatial wavelength of outgoing waves. This wave-stretching, or redshift, is then combined with compactification to resolve oscillatory solutions on infinite domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the cosmological scenario, the waves are also stretched, but the interpretation of wave-stretching is now due to the expansion of space and is called cosmological redshift. The &lt;strong>caveat&lt;/strong> is that the cosmological redshift is a physical effect. The cosmological constant changes the waveform physically. I expect that the impact of a sufficiently small cosmological constant will be negligible on the waveform but significant on numerical efficiency because of the different roles of time and space in the construction for large $L$.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="boundary-conditions">Boundary conditions&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In the asymptotically flat scenario, no numerical boundary conditions are needed because one places the outer boundary at future null infinity, which is an ingoing null surface. No signals can propagate faster than the speed of light, so no characteristics can enter the numerical domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the cosmological scenario, the outer boundary is spacelike. This is even better than an ingoing null boundary. A spacelike boundary will pull away any perturbations and further stabilize the code. This setup emulates excision at the black hole horizon. Consider the conformal diagrams above and think of spacelike null infinity, $\mathscr I^+$, as the spacelike black-hole singularity and the cosmological horizon as the event horizon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="radiation-extrapolation">Radiation extrapolation&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In the asymptotically flat scenario, gravitational waves are defined unambiguously at future null infinity. With the numerical outer boundary placed at future null infinity, one can directly read off the asymptotic fields and perform the relatively simple transformations to extract the gravitational radiation without any error-prone extrapolation procedures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the cosmological scenario, one would read off the radiation at the cosmological horizon. For large $L$, this radiation should match the radiation at future null infinity. Again, no extrapolation would be needed because the cosmological horizon is part of the simulation domain. The &lt;strong>caveat&lt;/strong> is that there is no unambiguous (coordinate-independent) definition of gravitational radiation at the cosmological horizon. In fact, the horizon itself depends on the coordinate system, even in pure de Sitter spacetime. We&amp;rsquo;ll need to understand this problem better once we have stable simulations. Note that the cosmological constant in our Universe is non-vanishing, so this problem is physically interesting and has been an ongoing research topic by &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashtekar&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08029" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bonga&lt;/a> and collaborators.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="stability">Stability&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It is well-known that de Sitter spacetimes are &amp;ldquo;more stable&amp;rdquo; than asymptotically flat spacetimes. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01205488" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friedrich&lt;/a> demonstrated the stability of asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes in 1986, years before the stability of Minkowski spacetimes was proven. We also know from &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bizoń and Rostworowski&lt;/a> that AdS with no-flux boundary conditions is globally unstable. The flat case is, in some imprecise sense, at the edge of stability with respect to the cosmological constant. A positive constant moves us towards better stability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beyond-the-horizon-there-be-monsters">Beyond the horizon there be monsters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hyperboloidal evolution of astrophysically relevant phenomena (binary black holes, neutron stars) is an open problem in numerical relativity. Today, the effort is driven mostly by David Hilditch and Alex Vañó-Viñuales. Since I gave up on this hard problem in 2013, this is the most exciting idea that I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet. Exciting because I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a reason why this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work. There may be monsters behind the horizon that I&amp;rsquo;m not yet aware of but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly worth tinkering for a few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would be remarkable if Misner&amp;rsquo;s suggestion would lead to a resolution of this important open problem. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see the outcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- The biggest frustration with this problem for me is that it's a hard binary: it works or it doesn't. And when it doesn't work, you can't do anything incremental to improve it. This idea is different. We know that evolution with a cosmological constant will work. Once we have a stable code, we can improve it bit by bit using smaller cosmological constants, better coordinates, improved extraction schemes, etc. -->
&lt;!-- If scri as a hypersurface is null, we say null scri. For example, asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes have a spacelike scri; asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes have a timelike scri. This usage avoids the confusing terminology around "null infinity" where it's unclear whether "null" refers to null geodesics or null generators. This is not standard usage but it's helpful to make the distinction when considering cases with non-vanishing cosmological constant. For more detail about the conformal boundary, see Frauendiener's review [Conformal Infinity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2004-1) or Valiente Kroon's book [Conformal Methods in General Relativity](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/conformal-methods-in-general-relativity/72AC946BEF2C74BD5D0AB790B31FAEB7). -->
&lt;!-- [^terminology]: There are two ways to add a qualifier to infinity, scri, or $\mathscr I$. You may call infinity, or $\mathscr I$, null, because it consists of endpoints of null geodesics or because its generators are null vector fields (in asymptotically flat spacetimes). There is usage for both in the literature. I'm following here Hawking \&amp; Ellis so $\mathscr I$ in de Sitter is spacelike infinity. A better usage would define scri as the endpoints of null geodesics and talk about -->
&lt;!-- One of the most influential events on my career was the funeral of [Jürgen Ehlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Ehlers), another giant of general relativity who was the founding director of the Max-Planck Institute for Gravitation where I did my Ph.D. thesis. -->

&lt;p>Contrary to common belief, physicists are in the business of making predictions more than fortune tellers or astrologers. The hows and whys, the fundamentals and principles, &amp;ldquo;whether or not the world has three dimensions,&amp;rdquo; all boil down to one question: Can you predict the future?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Predicting the future for a physicist is, of course, a much more accurate undertaking than for fortune tellers, astrologers, or &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/finance/news/wall-street-economists-consistently-wrong-171740454.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economists&lt;/a>. We want to know what happens to well-defined variables describing the mathematical idealization of a natural system given a snapshot in time&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We call this process &amp;ldquo;solving an initial value problem.&amp;rdquo; We solve an equation of motion, typically a partial differential equation (PDE), with prescribed initial data. The PDE is the mathematical idealization of our model of the physical system under consideration. That&amp;rsquo;s where all the whys and hows go. The PDE describes how the chosen variables of the system vary in relation to each other. The initial data is the snapshot of these variables at a given time. The solution to this initial value problem is our prediction of the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The language of a snapshot in time distinguishes time and space. But didn&amp;rsquo;t special relativity teach us that time by itself and space by itself are mere shadows? Well, it did, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t. Special relativity taught us that the notion of time and simultaneity is observer-dependent. But time is still a special dimension in a relativistic spacetime, distinct from its spatial friends. You can already see at the level of the metric signature, $(-+++)$, that time is special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To formulate an initial value problem, we need to split spacetime into space and time. In relativity, there are three approaches to splitting spacetime to formulate an initial value problem: Cauchy, characteristic, and hyperboloidal. Let&amp;rsquo;s take the flat, 1+1 dimensional spacetime to demonstrate these approaches. In standard coordinates $(t,r)$, the flat metric reads
$$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 \tag{1} \label{1} $$
The most intuitive approach is to take the snapshot at $t=0$. The corresponding surface&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> is called a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_surface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cauchy surface&lt;/a> and has specific desirable properties that generalize to more interesting cases. The associated &lt;a href="https://ems.press/books/esi/66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cauchy problem&lt;/a> plays a central role in mathematical and numerical relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also have null surfaces in relativity, named as such because they provide the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28linear_algebra%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nullspace&lt;/a> of the metric \eqref{1} through $t\pm r$. This null cone is fundamental in many aspects. First, it determines the &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-singularities/lightcone.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causal structure of spacetime&lt;/a>. Second, it describes the propagation of disturbances. In particular, massless fields propagate along the null cone. Even before the advent of relativity, it was known that disturbances to solutions of wave equations propagate along these special surfaces called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_characteristics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">characteristics&lt;/a>. One can provide data on such characteristic surfaces and solve a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2012-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">characteristic evolution problem&lt;/a>. This approach is particularly valuable in the modern era of gravitational-wave astronomy because gravitational waves are only defined at infinity along outgoing null directions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hyperboloidal-surfaces">Hyperboloidal surfaces&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The hyperboloidal approach is the odd one. You take a spacetime hyperboloid, say
$t^2 - r^2 = 1,$
and give initial data on the surface defined by
$t(r) = \sqrt{1+r^2}.$
This construction seems weird and arbitrary when you first encounter it. Why would you do something like this? How is this surface a &lt;em>snapshot&lt;/em>? Why not pick another transformation?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many relativists feel that hyperboloidal surfaces are somewhat unnatural, lacking the simplicity and elegance of the Cauchy or characteristic approaches. Below, I demonstrate how hyperboloidal surfaces extend the mathematical notion of a sphere to relativity and satisfy a physical principle. The concepts that we&amp;rsquo;ll encounter will lead us to speculations in the quantum realm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A circle is a set of points equidistant from a given point. This definition is among the purest in mathematics&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. To derive the equation for a circle, consider the Euclidean metric in two dimensions
$$ ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2. $$
The set of points $\{x,y\}$ at distance $R$ from the origin satisfies
$$ x^2 + y^2 = R^2. $$
The circle (or sphere in three dimensions) is the simplest nontrivial example of a constant curvature surface, with its curvature being the reciprocal of its radius, $K=1/R$. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the corresponding object in relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is the set of events equidistant from a given event?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the relativistic setting, spacetime distance is proper time. Using the metric \eqref{1}, the set of events $\{t, r\}$ at proper time $T$ from the origin satisfies
$$ - t^2 + r^2 = \pm T^2. $$
This equation describes a spacetime hyperbola. The sign in the equation determines whether the hyperbola is spacelike or timelike&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. We&amp;rsquo;ll pick the negative sign for the spacelike hyperbola because we aim to construct a snapshot. I mentioned before that time is special, so let&amp;rsquo;s solve the above equation for time to obtain the future sheet of the spacelike hyperbola
$$ t(r) = \sqrt{T^2+r^2}.$$
This spacelike surface consists of points at proper time $T$ from the origin. Like the circle above, this surface has constant curvature, $K=1/T.$ The higher dimensional version of a hyperbola is called the hyperboloid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We see that hyperboloids are the relativistic analogs of spheres. Hyperboloids are as natural in Lorentzian manifolds as spheres are in Riemannian manifolds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The circle has another attractive property: among all figures with a given area, the circle has the smallest perimeter.

Such optimization problems appear in many areas. One that is familiar to most people from early childhood is the soap bubble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In mathematical terms, soap bubbles are minimal surfaces enclosing a fixed volume of air. The variational problem has the following action
$$ S = A - \lambda \cdot V. \tag{2} \label{2} $$
Minimize the area $A$ with the constraint that the volume $V$ is fixed. The mathematics of soap bubbles includes fascinating open problems with many &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/monumental-math-proof-solves-triple-bubble-problem-and-more-20221006/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent developments&lt;/a>. Frank Morgan, who proved the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bubble_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double bubble theorem&lt;/a>, has a wonderful lecture on the topic.&lt;/p>

Here&amp;rsquo;s a particularly relevant quote from the lecture&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you want to understand the universe, start out by understanding the soap bubble.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frank Morgan&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s try to understand the universe by understanding the soap bubble. We must first answer the following question as we did with the circle:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is the relativistic analog of a soap bubble?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Formally, we can use the action for the soap bubble \eqref{2} and go one dimension higher.
$$ S = V - \lambda \cdot W. \tag{3}\label{3} $$
Now, the task is to &lt;em>maximize the volume&lt;/em> $V$ with the constraint that the &lt;em>spacetime volume&lt;/em> $W$ is fixed. In contrast to the soap bubble problem, we&amp;rsquo;re not looking for a minimal hypersurface in the relativistic setup but a maximal one. The minimal hypersurface would be null with vanishing volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see the solution of this problem in a simple case. We compute the relativistic volume by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Denoting the determinant of the induced metric on the hypersurface by $h$ and the determinant of the spacetime metric by $g$, we have
$$ S = \int \sqrt{h}\ d^3x - \lambda \int \sqrt{-g}\ d^4x. $$
The extremization of this action leads to the requirement of constant mean curvature: $K = \lambda$, where $K$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. We&amp;rsquo;ll do this for the 1+1 Minkowski metric to find an explicit expression for the maximizer. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for an embedding, $t=t(r)$, that maximizes the action for the relativistic bubble. The induced metric is
$$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 = \left(-t&amp;rsquo;^2 + 1\right) dr^2, $$
where $t&amp;rsquo;\equiv dt(r)/dr$. The volume from the origin to some radius $R$ is
$$ V = \int_0^R \sqrt{h} \ dr = \int_0^R \sqrt{1-t&amp;rsquo;^2}\ dr. $$
To calculate the spacetime volume, we need a reference surface. It turns out that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter which surface, so let&amp;rsquo;s just take the surface $t=0$. The spacetime volume is given by
$$ W = \int_0^R \int_0^{t(r)} \sqrt{-g} \ dt dr = \int_0^R t(r) dr. $$
Bringing these expressions together in the action \eqref{3}, we can read off the Lagrangian density
$$ \mathscr{L} = \sqrt{1-t&amp;rsquo;^2} - \lambda t. $$
The Euler-Lagrange equation for varying $t(r)$ with respect to the parameter $r$ reads
$$ \frac{d}{dr} \frac{\partial\mathscr{L}}{\partial t&amp;rsquo;} = \frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\partial t} \ \iff &lt;br>
\frac{d}{dr} \frac{t&amp;rsquo;}{\sqrt{1-t&amp;rsquo;^2}} = \lambda. $$
We integrate by $r$ and solve for $t&amp;rsquo;$ with the boundary condition $t&amp;rsquo;(0)=0$
$$ t&amp;rsquo;(r) = \pm \frac{\lambda r}{\sqrt{1+ \lambda^2 r^2}}. $$
By choosing the positive sign and integrating again, we get the equation for the spacetime hyperboloid
$$ t(r) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\lambda^2} + r^2}. $$
We recognize the mean extrinsic curvature as $K=\lambda$ from our previous discussion on the relativistic analog of a circle. We now see that the hyperboloid is the relativistic analog of a soap bubble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may wonder what determines the value of the constant mean curvature. It&amp;rsquo;s the spacetime volume that we prescribe in the constraint. The larger the spacetime volume to be enclosed, the smaller the constant mean curvature. You can see this behavior in the Penrose diagram below. As I mentioned above, the reference surface doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter for the qualitative discussion. You can pick $t=0$ or $u=t-r=0$. The spacetime volume enclosed by the hyperboloid with $K=0.5$ is larger than the spacetime volume enclosed by the one with $K=2$ in both cases. The difference is shaded yellow.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
Smaller curvature $K$ corresponds to larger spacetime volume irrespective of the reference surface.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This behavior is actually very intuitive, as it&amp;rsquo;s the same for a soap bubble. The larger the volume of air that the bubble needs to enclose, the larger the bubble, and therefore the smaller the curvature of the bubble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, there&amp;rsquo;s a clear analogy between soap bubbles and hyperboloids. Soap bubbles are minimal surfaces enclosing a fixed volume of air. Hyperboloids are maximal surfaces enclosing a fixed volume of spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="quantum-foam">Quantum foam&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What would the extremization of the action \eqref{3} mean physically? Does space arise from the extremization of spacetime bubbles?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been long predicted that spacetime shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be smooth at the Planck scale due to quantum fluctuations. It should be &amp;ldquo;foamy,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bubbly,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;grainy,&amp;rdquo; or whatever you want to call it. Wheeler, the naming authority of theoretical physics&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, called this the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum foam&lt;/a>. A foam is defined as a dispersion of bubbles, and we have just seen that the relativistic generalization of a bubble is a hyperboloid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We arrived at the realm of speculation. We don&amp;rsquo;t know how to test the quantum foam idea experimentally. But we can imagine that quantum foam arises from quantum fluctuations of spacetime bubbles. The hypersurfaces that enclose those bubbles are hyperboloids. As usual, this mental image gives rise to further questions. What is the mechanism for the formation of such hyperboloids? How are they related to quantum fields?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One idea is that the hypersurfaces arise through entanglement. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about &lt;a href="../../hyperboloidal-holography/">hyperboloidal holography&lt;/a> before, where I argued that holographic entanglement entropy naturally extends to flat spacetime if we use hyperboloids as time slices. The variational principle suggests that these surfaces could also be useful in the context of &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-new-paradox-black-holes-appear-to-evade-heat-death-20230606/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum complexity&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These speculations open more questions than answers. Nevertheless, we now have a better sense that soap bubbles and their clusters may indeed provide a key to understanding spacetime.&lt;/p>

Often, qualitative diagrams are sufficient if you&amp;rsquo;re mainly interested in the essential causal relationships. But sometimes, for numerical work or for your own understanding, you need a quantitatively correct diagram.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below, we draw Penrose diagrams using free and open-source software. We&amp;rsquo;ll draw the diagrams using the LaTeX package &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikZ&lt;/a> (not a drawing program but a program that draws&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>). We&amp;rsquo;ll use Python to perform transformations when we hit the computational limitations of TikZ.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-note">
&lt;div>
The code for all diagrams below is on my &lt;a href="https://github.com/anilzen/anilzen.github.io/tree/main/content/post/2022/drawing-penrose-diagrams/tikz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website repository&lt;/a>.

&lt;h3 id="the-basic-idea-behind-penrose-diagrams">The basic idea behind Penrose diagrams&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Penrose diagram is an extension, or better, a &lt;em>completion&lt;/em> of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_diagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski diagram&lt;/a>. Like in the Minkowski diagram, time is vertical, space is horizontal, and null rays are at 45 degrees to the axes. In contrast to the Minkowski diagram, a Penrose diagram includes &amp;ldquo;points at infinity&amp;rdquo; added by compactification, thereby visualizing the rich structure of infinity arising from the unification of space and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are two beautiful &lt;a href="https://tikz.net/relativity_penrose_diagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikZ diagrams&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/researcharea/cms/people/Izaak-Neutelings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Izaak Neutelings&lt;/a>. On the left is the Minkowski diagram. Spacetime extends infinitely in all directions. On the right is the Penrose diagram representing the entire spacetime in a finite square.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Compactification maps the Minkowski diagram to the Penrose diagram by mapping the null directions to a finite interval. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how that works.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="minkowski-spacetime">Minkowski spacetime&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Consider the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with standard spherical coordinates: $t \in (-\infty,\infty)$, $r \in [0,\infty)$, $\theta\in[0,\pi]$, $\varphi\in[0,2\pi)$ with metric
$$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2, $$
where $d\sigma^2=d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\varphi^2$. Penrose diagrams are two-dimensional, so we essentially ignore the angular coordinates represented by the $d\sigma^2$ piece. Each point on the diagram, except the line at the origin, represents a sphere. Spherical light rays propagate along the directions $t+r$ and $t-r$. These directions are called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_vector" target="_blank" rel="noopener">null&lt;/a> because they are in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28linear_algebra%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nullspace&lt;/a> of the metric.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Underlying the Penrose diagrams are coordinates, $T$ and $R$, which compactify these null directions:
$$ T+R = \frac{2}{\pi}\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\arctan}(t+r),$$
$$ T-R = \frac{2}{\pi}\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\arctan}(t-r). $$
The scale factor $2/\pi$ is to map the range of the coordinates to $T\pm R \in(-1,1)$. Note that I&amp;rsquo;m not including the endpoints in the intervals yet. The Penrose compactification procedure involves the conformal completion of the spacetime, which adds the points at infinity after a regularizing rescaling. This detail is not relevant for the diagrams but is important for geometry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Penrose coordinates $(T,R)$ read in terms of the standard $(t,r)$ as:
$$ T(t,r) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(t+r) + \arctan(t-r) \right)$$
$$ R(t,r) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(t+r) - \arctan(t-r) \right)$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s make some plots using these coordinates. I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate plotting time surfaces (level sets of a time coordinate). Say you&amp;rsquo;d like to draw constant $t$ surfaces in the Penrose diagram. You might be tempted to solve the above relationships for a graph function $T(R;t)$ with constant $t$. But it is easier to let the machine do the work and plot the surfaces parametrically. Define the functions $T(t,r)$ and $R(t,r)$ in TikZ as follows:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The two versions of the diagram illustrate a coordinate-dependent feature that confuses even the experts. The $t$ surfaces intersect at spatial infinity, $i^0$, on both diagrams. On the left, they are tangent to each other, while on the right, they are not. So this seems to be a coordinate-dependent feature. Penrose used the inverse tangent function in his original papers. Many other choices exist. For example, using the hyperbolic tangent, the mapping reads
$$ T+R = \textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\tanh}(t+r),$$
$$ T-R = \textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\tanh}(t-r). $$
This mapping gives the diagram on the right where $t$ surfaces are not tangential at spatial infinity. There&amp;rsquo;s a subtlety here. Conformal compactification with hyperbolic tangent is not regular when you include the angular dimensions. So be careful what you choose for the mapping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I draw Penrose diagrams typically to present the causal structure of &lt;a href="https://hyperboloid.al" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperboloidal&lt;/a> surfaces. Such surfaces behave like spacetime hyperboloids: they are spacelike everywhere, including null horizons. Spacetime hyperboloids are typically defined by the level sets of $\tau$ as
$$ t^2 - r^2 = \tau^2 \implies \tau = \pm \sqrt{t^2 - r^2}. $$
This construction appears in many models, such as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milne model&lt;/a> of cosmology, &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dirac&amp;rsquo;s point-form&lt;/a> of relativistic dynamics, the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0303006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">de Boer-Solodukhin&lt;/a> holography of Minkowski spacetime, and the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buchholz-Roberts framework&lt;/a> of relativistic QED. However, these surfaces are not generally useful for studying evolution in time because they intersect at future null infinity. This may not be immediately obvious from their definition, but you can see it right away on the Penrose diagram (left panel below).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A better option for a foliation of Minkowski spacetime, illustrated on the right panel above, is to use time-shifted hyperboloids. We pick one spacetime hyperboloid, say, with unit radius, and shift it in time by $\tau$, like this
$$ (t-\tau)^2 - r^2 = 1 \implies \tau = t \pm \sqrt{1+r^2}. $$
Choosing the minus sign gives a future hyperboloidal foliation. The surfaces do not intersect but provide a smooth foliation of future null infinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This example demonstrates how causal structures that may not be immediately clear from the formulas can be illustrated and understood with Penrose diagrams. Other examples include the counterintuitive causal structure of hyperboloidal surfaces or the intersection of standard time surfaces at spatial infinity. We can demonstrate such properties by calculations, but it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to understand them with the help of a Penrose diagram.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="reading-data-into-tikz">Reading data into TikZ&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>TikZ is limited in its data processing capabilities. As a consequence, the evaluation of the lines in the plots takes a while. Once you move away from Minkowski spacetime, the transformations become too complicated for TikZ. To handle complicated mathematical transformations, you can generate the data for the plots in Python, write them in a file, and plot them with TikZ. Below is the Python code to generate the data files for each time surface.&lt;/p>

If you&amp;rsquo;re up for it, you might prefer using a Python library such as &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/tikzplotlib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tikzplotlib&lt;/a> to avoid going back and forth between Python and TikZ.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="schwarzschild-spacetime">Schwarzschild spacetime&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Schwarzschild line element in standard (Droste) coordinates reads
$$ ds^2 = - f(r) dt^2 + \frac{1}{f(r)} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2, \tag{SS} \label{1}$$
where
$$ f(r) = 1-\frac{2 M}{r},$$
or in dimensionless coordinates
$$ f(r) = 1-\frac{1}{r}.$$
Dimensionless coordinates are similar to setting $M=1/2$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The metric is singular where $f(r)$ vanishes, at $r=1$. This surface is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">event horizon&lt;/a>, but the metric singularity is a coordinate artifact. There are regular coordinates across the event horizon, such as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullstrand%E2%80%93Painlev%C3%A9_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gullstrand–Painlevé&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington%E2%80%93Finkelstein_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eddington–Finkelstein&lt;/a> coordinates. In fact, we must use such regular coordinates to draw Penrose diagrams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Penrose diagrams for Schwarzschild spacetime are traditionally drawn using a compactification of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Szekeres_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kruskal coordinates&lt;/a>. Let&amp;rsquo;s copy them from Wikipedia (for a derivation, see, for example, the Appendix of my &lt;a href="https://anilzen.github.io/publication/zenginoglu-2007-conformal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thesis&lt;/a>):
$$ \tau = (r-1) e^r \sinh \tfrac{t}{2}, $$
$$ \rho = (r-1) e^r \cosh \tfrac{t}{2}. $$
The coordinates of the Penrose diagram are compactified along the null directions just as in the Minkowski case:
$$ T = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(\tau+\rho) + \arctan(\tau-\rho) \right)$$
$$ R = \frac{1}{\pi}\left( \arctan(\tau+\rho) - \arctan(\tau-\rho) \right)$$
The transformations are more complicated, so we will use Python codes to generate the lines and plot them with TikZ. Here&amp;rsquo;s the Python function to construct the compactified Kruskal coordinates.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The Schwarzschild time slices intersect at the bifurcation sphere, $\mathcal{B}$, and at spatial infinity $i^0$. When you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the behavior of fields near the black hole and far away from it (say, to study gravitational waves), it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://anilzen.github.io/publication/zenginoglu-2011-geometric/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better&lt;/a> to use non-intersecting time slices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most useful time functions are related to the Schwarzschild time by a &amp;ldquo;height&amp;rdquo; shift that depends only on the radial coordinate:
$$ t \to t + h(r). $$
For example, the height function for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullstrand%E2%80%93Painlev%C3%A9_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gullstrand–Painlevé&lt;/a> coordinates is
$$ h_{\rm GP} (r) = -2 \sqrt{r} + \ln\frac{\sqrt{r}+1}{\sqrt{r}-1}. $$
Note that the height function is singular at the horizon. This singularity is needed to counteract the singularity of Schwarzschild time slices near the bifurcation sphere. Gullstrand–Painlevé gives a nice foliation of the future event horizon, $\mathcal{H}^+$, but the time slices still intersect at spatial infinity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We need a height function that&amp;rsquo;s singular both near and far from the black hole. This idea underlies the construction of hyperboloidal coordinates. For example,
$$ h_{\rm Hyp} (r) = \sqrt{1+ r_\ast^2}, $$
gives the hyperboloidal foliation on the left panel below. The slices do not intersect. Instead, you get a nice, smooth foliation of the full exterior domain.

&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it! I hope this helps for the handful of people out there who draw Penrose diagrams. If you have any questions about the diagrams or the source files, email me at &lt;a href="mailto:anil@umd.edu">anil@umd.edu&lt;/a>. I plan to write two more posts on Penrose compactification that should be of broader interest. Stay tuned!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- These coordinates are good for plotting the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution but they are too complicated if you're primarily interested in the exterior region. You can draw a Penrose diagram for Schwarzschild just like in the Minkowski case by using the tortoise coordinate. The reason is that the $t,r$ portion of the Schwarzschild metric is conformally flat in the tortoise coordinate. Since Penrose diagrams are conformal diagrams, all the usual tricks apply. -->
&lt;!-- The Schwarzschild case reduces to the Minkowski case when we switch to the tortoise coordinate (up to a constant)
$$ r_\ast = \int \frac{dr}{f(r)} = r + 2 M \log \left(\frac{r}{2M}-1\right).$$
The Schwarzschild metric \eqref{1} becomes
$$ ds^2 = f(r(r_\ast)) (- dt^2 + dr_\ast^2) + r(r_\ast)^2 d\sigma^2. $$
Ignoring the angular part, the spacetime metric is just a conformal Minkowski metric in coordinates $(t,r_\ast)$ with in- and outgoing coordinates $t+r_\ast$ and $t-r_\ast$. For a Penrose diagram, you can consider the Schwarzschild metric to be simply $ -dt^2 + dr_\ast^2$. The main difference is the domain of $r_\ast$. While the domain of $r$ in Minkowski is $[0,\infty)$, the domain of the tortoise coordinate $r_\ast$ in Schwarzschild is $(-\infty, \infty)$. This difference is why the Minkowski conformal diagram is a triangle, whereas the conformal diagram for the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime is a diamond. -->

&lt;p>The featured image on the tweet above shows &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Escher&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Limit_III" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle Limit III&lt;/a> depicting the Poincaré model of hyperbolic geometry. Escher was interested in constructing an infinitely repeating pattern in a finite figure. When the brilliant geometer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Scott_MacDonald_Coxeter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coxeter&lt;/a> shared with him a reprint of one of his lectures on hyperbolic geometry, Escher figured out how to create such &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tessalations&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-circle-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story&lt;/a> of how Escher managed to create these &lt;a href="https://mathstat.slu.edu/escher/index.php/Circle_Limit_Exploration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four woodcuts&lt;/a> is fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-close-in-on-logical-laws-for-the-big-bang-20211110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quanta article&lt;/a> in the tweet above reports the difficulties in constructing something like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdS/CFT correspondence&lt;/a> for physical spacetimes. While we have a realization of holographic duality based on anti-de Sitter spacetimes, a similar construction on flat or de Sitter spacetimes has been elusive, supposedly because these spacetimes do not possess hyperbolic geometry. A week after the tweet above, there was another &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/symmetries-reveal-clues-about-the-holographic-universe-20220112/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quanta article&lt;/a> with hyperbolic geometry as its featured image. Clearly, there is some hype around hyperbolic geometry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main argument is that spatial slices of AdS are hyperbolic, which seems to be essential for AdS/CFT, so living in hyperbolic geometry makes it easier for the fish in Escher&amp;rsquo;s drawing to know quantum gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The fish doesn&amp;rsquo;t think because the fish knows everything.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We are, however, not like those fish; we want to discover quantum gravity. The obstacle remains that our physical models for spacetime are either asymptotically flat (for isolated systems) or de Sitter (for cosmology).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I argue below that there is no need to be jealous of the fish. We do live in hyperbolic geometry; we just don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says &amp;ldquo;Morning, boys. How&amp;rsquo;s the water?&amp;rdquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes &amp;ldquo;What the hell is water?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="little-fish-big-fish">Little fish, big fish&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a short review of the hyperbolic fish in Escher&amp;rsquo;s drawing. Hyperbolic geometry is typically introduced in a fictitious higher dimensional Minkowski space using the equation for a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperboloid&lt;/a> in Cartesian coordinates. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using spherical coordinates foreshadowing an application below, so we have the Minkowski space with line element
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2,$$
where $d\sigma^2=d\sigma^2+\sin^2\theta \ d\varphi^2$, the usual metric on the unit sphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spheres and hyperboloids may seem very different, but they are analogous to each other. Just like the unit sphere is the set of points at unit Euclidean distance from the origin, the unit hyperboloid is the set of points at unit Minkowski distance from the origin: the hyperboloid is simply a (pseudo)sphere of Minkowski space
$$t^2-r^2=1. \tag{1} \label{1}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We already have the first hint that we live in hyperbolic geometry! The hyperboloid describes the &lt;a href="../../hyperbolic-relativity/">kinematic space of special relativity&lt;/a>. But this was rather anticlimactic so let&amp;rsquo;s go a bit further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can derive and represent the intrinsic metric of hyperbolic geometry in various equivalent ways. For example, setting $t=\cosh \xi$ and $r=\sinh \xi$ satisfies the equation for the hyperboloid (\ref{1}) identically, and gives us the hyperbolic line element
$$ ds^2_{\mathbb{H}^3} = d\xi^2+ \sinh^2\xi \ d\sigma^2.$$
Note the similarity of this hyperbolic metric with the metric on the unit sphere.
Coordinates are labels and it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to see hyperbolic geometry in different representations. Instead of introducing hyperbolic functions, let&amp;rsquo;s solve (\ref{1}) directly
$$ t = \sqrt{1+r^2}. \tag{2} \label{2} $$
Replacing the $dt$ term with the differential of this relation in the Minkowski metric, we get
$$ ds^2_{\mathbb{H}^3} = \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2}dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2}. \tag{3} \label{3} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get Escher&amp;rsquo;s image of a disk, we need to map the hyperboloid model with its infinite range in $r$ to the unit &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poincaré disk model&lt;/a>. We relabel the radial points using
$$ r = \frac{2\rho}{1-\rho^2}, \tag{4}\label{4}$$
and obtain the familiar &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model#Metric_and_curvature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">line element for the Poincaré ball&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
$$ ds^2_{\mathbb{H}^3} = \textcolor{darkorange}{\frac{4}{(1-\rho^2)^2}\left( d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\sigma^2 \right)}. $$
The metric blows up near the boundary, which is how Escher packs the infinitely many fish in a repeating pattern into the disk. Remember that the fish have the same size. The Poincaré disk is a conformal model of hyperbolic geometry distorting sizes but keeping the shapes (or rather local angles) invariant, so the fish actually don&amp;rsquo;t know that they are packed so densely, contrary to claims about their omniscient nature. As far as the fish are concerned, they don&amp;rsquo;t see the distortions and might even think they live in flat space&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &amp;#x1f609;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="swimming-in-anti-de-sitter">Swimming in anti-de Sitter&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The hype around hyperbolic geometry among quanta is because cuts of AdS are hyperbolic spaces. In fact, AdS is introduced very similarly to hyperbolic geometry&amp;mdash;starting with a fictitious higher dimensional Minkowski space. This Minkowski space, however, has two time dimensions (which is rather awkward): $ds^2 = -dt_1^2 - dt_2^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2$. We write the hyperboloid as $-t_1^2-t_2^2+r^2=-1$. This relation can be solved identically by $t_1 = \sqrt{1+r^2} \cos t$ and $t_2 = \sqrt{1+r^2} \sin t$, giving the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-de_Sitter_space#Global_coordinates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdS metric in global coordinates&lt;/a>
$$ ds^2_{\rm{AdS}} = - \left(1+r^2\right) dt^2 + \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2}.$$
AdS spacetime has many &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counterintuitive aspects&lt;/a>; it&amp;rsquo;s not even stable against small &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perturbations&lt;/a>. But you can immediately see that its $t$-slices have hyperbolic geometry by comparing them to the metric (\ref{3}), which is the crucial aspect for quantum gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I promised you to end your jealousy, but so far, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been pressing on the wound. The question remains: how do we go from our usual flat spacetime with line element
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2$$
to the hyperbolic three-metric as time slices? Yes, we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered the kinematic space of special relativity, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a spacetime metric&amp;mdash;time is missing! Considering the usual time slices, there is nothing hyperbolic about the flat geometry of $dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2$.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="time-heals-all-wounds">Time heals all wounds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In relativity, there is no notion of absolute time; we can develop our own simultaneity to connect observers and call it a proper day. Therefore, the geometry of the three-space connecting these observers is also not invariant but depends on a choice of time. Many familiar notions such as simultaneity, volume, area become unfamiliar through such reparametrizations of spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The choice of time also determines whether the geometry of the three-space is Euclidean or hyperbolic. We are free to pick our preferred time coordinate, so let&amp;rsquo;s pick a time that makes space hyperbolic and end the jealousy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen this when we encountered the kinematic space of special relativity in our derivation of the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry. Now, instead of finding intrinsic coordinates as in (\ref{2}), we introduce a new time coordinate as
$$ \tau = t - \sqrt{1+r^2}. \tag{5} \label{5} $$
The resulting metric is not a three-dimensional intrinsic spatial metric but a transformed Minkowski metric with timelike, null, and spacelike directions
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 - \frac{2r}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} d\tau dr + \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2}.$$
Voilà! The $\tau$ slices have hyperbolic geometry. Relabeling the radial points as in (\ref{4}) brings us to a foliation whose sections are the Poincaré balls
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 + \frac{8\rho}{(1-\rho^2)^2} d\tau d\rho + \textcolor{darkorange}{\frac{4}{(1-\rho^2)^2} \left( d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\sigma^2\right)}.$$
Note that this metric is still the flat Minkowski metric with all its usual geometric properties, such as vanishing curvature. The important difference is that the points along the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_%28topology%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideal boundary&lt;/a> do not sit at spatial infinity but null infinity. The cuts $\rho=1$ along each $\tau$ slice corresponds to what is called a celestial sphere. This allows us to make the connection back to quantum gravity, because the celestial sphere is indeed the stage for an attempt at a &lt;a href="../../hyperboloidal-holography/">holographic description&lt;/a> called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celestial holography&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ideal boundary seems like an ideal place for quantum gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperbolic-de-sitter">Hyperbolic de Sitter&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-close-in-on-logical-laws-for-the-big-bang-20211110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quanta article&lt;/a> discusses the difficulties in constructing an AdS/CFT correspondence in de Sitter spacetimes. Again, we can use coordinates to make the time slices of de Sitter hyperbolic, but the transformations are a bit tricky because de Sitter space has a different conformal geometry. For example, conformal infinity is spacelike (as opposed to timelike for AdS and null for Minkowski).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is another infinity in de Sitter that depends on coordinates and is useful for us. Consider the de Sitter metric in static coordinates
$$ ds^2_{\rm{dS}} = - \left(1-r^2\right) dt^2 + \frac{1}{1-r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2.$$
The singularity at $r=1$ corresponds to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_horizon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cosmological horizon&lt;/a>. The horizon singularity is a coordinate singularity similar to the singularity at the black hole horizon of Schwarzschild spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the transformation that gets us to hyperbolic time slices
$$ r = \sinh \xi \sinh \tau, \qquad \cosh t = \frac{\cosh \tau}{\sqrt{1-\sinh^2 \xi \sinh^2\tau}} $$
The transformed metric is comparatively simple
$$ ds^2_{\rm{dS}} = - d\tau^2 + \sinh ^2 \tau \left( d\xi^2 + \sinh^2\xi\ d\sigma^2 \right).$$
We recognize the hyperbolic geometry on $\tau=$const. slices. Alternatively, we can abuse notation and use the same letter for $r=\sinh\xi$ to get the purple representation of the hyperbolic metric
$$ ds^2_{\rm{dS}} = - d\tau^2 + \sinh ^2 \tau \left( \textcolor{purple}{\frac{1}{1+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\sigma^2} \right).$$
The Poincaré disk follows from a simple relabeling of the radial points (\ref{4}). This representation of the de Sitter metric is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_space#Open_slicing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open slicing&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m ignoring subtleties, such as the domain of transformations and the region covered by coordinates in the conformal diagram. We still see that we can choose to live in hyperbolic geometry if we want to, even in de Sitter spacetimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with the de Sitter metric in open slicing is its time-dependence. Especially for numerical studies, coordinates in which the metric is explicitly static are preferable. A better approach to construct a hyperbolic slicing is to consider the static patch and make a transformation similar to the flat case. First we push the horizon to infinity
$$ r_\ast = \int \frac{1}{1-r^2}dr = \mathrm{arctanh} \ r. $$
The de Sitter metric on the static patch becomes
$$ ds^2_{\mathrm{dS}} = \frac{1}{\cosh^2 r_\ast} \left( -dt^2 + dr_\ast^2 \right) + \tanh^2 r_\ast d\sigma^2. $$
Now we can do the same transformation as in (\ref{5}), take $\tau=$const., and get the following metric on the time slices
$$ \frac{1}{\cosh^2 r_\ast} \left(\frac{1}{1+r_\ast^2} dr_\ast^2 + \sinh^2 r_\ast d\sigma^2 \right). $$
This metric is not quite the hyperbolic metric, but has other nice properties for numerical calculations that I&amp;rsquo;ll write about in another post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="this-is-water">This is Water&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The point of this post is that you can find suitable coordinates that make space hyperbolic. There is nothing to be jealous about Escher&amp;rsquo;s fish. It may well be that physically motivated time slices of flat spacetime are naturally hyperbolic but we don&amp;rsquo;t experience it because the speed of light is so large.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are these time transformations physically motivated? What do they mean? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t a preferred time slice contradict the principle of covariance? I&amp;rsquo;ll leave those questions for another post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy the swim.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was blown away by this as a young high schooler interested in physics and philosophy. To me, the recognition that natural laws dynamically govern space and time was a triumph of physics over philosophy, of Einstein over Kant, of empirical determination over &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic%E2%80%93synthetic_distinction#Kant%27s_version_and_the_a_priori_/_a_posteriori_distinction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthetic a priori&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As fascinated as I was by special relativity, the formalism seemed relatively obscure. I recognized patterns in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lorentz transformations&lt;/a> but missed a deeper insight into the origins of this structure. At college, I considered various standard derivations of relativistic effects, such as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_aberration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relativistic aberration&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_precession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas precession&lt;/a>, tedious and boring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple example is Einstein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">velocity-addition formula&lt;/a>. In Galilean relativity, which corresponds to our everyday experience, we can just add velocities. In special relativity, the speed of light is constant, so the addition of velocities must be such that no composition of velocities exceeds the speed of light. In the simplest case of collinear motion (velocities pointing in the same direction), velocity addition becomes speed addition and looks like this
$$ \tag{1} \label{1}
u = \frac{u_1+u_2}{1+\tfrac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}} $$
The speed of light, $c$, can never be exceeded with this composition law. While we can understand the result, it is not intuitively clear how this addition rule is related to the structure of space and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that relativistic calculations have natural interpretations in hyperbolic geometry. This viewpoint not only simplifies the calculations but also provides deeper insights into the theory. Its power extends beyond special relativity into machine learning and general relativity. And it all starts with Minkowski.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperbole">Hyperbole&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 1908, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski&lt;/a> gave a &lt;a href="https://www.math.nyu.edu/~tschinke/papers/yuri/14minkowski/raum-und-zeit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lecture&lt;/a> about a new mathematical model for space and time. In his opening remarks, he stated boldly that, from now on, space and time are mere shadows of a more fundamental union: spacetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski&lt;/a> (1908)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The quote is by now famous. It has made its way to various outlets since appearing on the cover page of Synge&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Relativity-Special-J-L-Synge/dp/B000GP7PX4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">textbook on relativity&lt;/a> in 1956. But when Minkowski made the statement, it was considered hyperbole and encountered resistance from physicists and mathematicians alike.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The spacetime view became widely celebrated a few years after the lecture because of its central role in general relativity. In the same lecture, Minkowski also promoted a non-Euclidean approach to spacetime. As a Göttingen mathematics professor, he recognized the non-Euclidean geometry of special relativity. This idea, however, didn&amp;rsquo;t gain traction as widely as the idea of spacetime. Only in the last 20 years has there been renewed interest in the hyperbolic nature of special relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To see why hyperbolic geometry is the natural geometry for special relativity, consider a two-dimensional spacetime with coordinates $(t,x)$ and Minkowski metric
$$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2. $$
A natural object for a metric is the set of points at unit distance from the origin. In two-dimensional Euclidean space, we get a circle, $x^2+y^2=1$. In two-dimensional Minkowski space, we get a hyperbola&lt;br>
$$ \tag{2}\label{2} t^2 - x^2 = 1. $$
Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s drawing below shows this hyperbola for $t&amp;gt;0$. In higher dimensions, you get the one-sheeted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperboloid&lt;/a>, also called hyperbolic hyperboloid.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In his lecture, Minkowski demonstrated that Lorentz transformations are hyperbolic rotations that leave the hyperbola (\ref{2}) invariant. He died in January 1909 before he could develop this idea further, but it was embraced by a few other scientists, particularly by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sommerfeld&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vari%C4%87ak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varičak&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Robb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robb&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borel&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The principle of relativity corresponds to the hypothesis that the kinematic space is a space of constant negative curvature, the space of Lobachevsky and Bolyai. The value of the radius of curvature is the speed of light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borel&lt;/a> (1913)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The mathematical formalism for a hyperbolic rotation is just like a regular rotation, except with hyperbolic functions instead of trigonometric functions. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperbolic functions&lt;/a> are related to their trigonometric counterparts through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions#Complex_trigonometric_definitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex angles&lt;/a>. An intuitive way to think about the hyperbolic rotation is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squeeze mapping&lt;/a>, which should be familiar to anyone who has seen a Lorentz transformation on a spacetime diagram.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the Lorentz boost with relative speed $v$ between frames
$$ L(v)= \begin{pmatrix}
\gamma &amp;amp; -\gamma \beta \\
-\gamma \beta &amp;amp; \gamma
\end{pmatrix}, $$
where we defined the rescaled speed $\beta:=\tfrac{v}{c}$ and the Lorentz factor $\gamma:=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$. We can write it as a hyperbolic rotation with angle $w$:
$$ L(w)= \begin{pmatrix}
\cosh w &amp;amp; -\sinh w \\
-\sinh w &amp;amp; \cosh w
\end{pmatrix}, $$
where the Lorentz factor becomes $\gamma=\cosh w$ and the rescaled speed becomes $\beta=\tanh w$. So the Lorentz transformation is simply a rotation in hyperbolic space with an angle, $w$, related to the observer&amp;rsquo;s speed as $v=c \ \mathrm{arctanh}\ w$. Its inverse is just a rotation with the inverse angle, $L(w)^{-1}=L(-w)$. We can directly add the hyperbolic angles instead of dealing with weird addition formulas because composition of rotations along the same dimension is additive $L(w_1)L(w_2)=L(w_1+w_2)$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Physicists usually think in terms of velocities and speeds, not hyperbolic angles. Writing the angle addition in terms of speeds, we get
$$ \beta = \tanh (w_1+w_2) = \frac{\tanh w_1+\tanh w_2}{1+\tanh w_1 \tanh w_2} = \frac{\beta_1+\beta_2}{1+\beta_1 \beta_2}. $$
Einstein&amp;rsquo;s velocity addition (\ref{1}) becomes a consequence of hyperbolic identities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is much more that one can simplify or understand with this viewpoint. For example, the formula for the Doppler shift is a simple $e^w$. The non-commutativity of general Lorentz boosts in higher dimensions becomes immediately apparent: Lorentz boosts do not commute just like rotations do not commute. The Thomas precession becomes easier to visualize as the consequence of parallel transport of vectors in the curved velocity space (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holonomy transformation&lt;/a>). Many other calculations and ideas in special relativity translate to simple exercises in hyperbolic geometry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re intrigued, follow the rabbit. Scott Walter&amp;rsquo;s papers are excellent for the historical developments: &lt;a href="https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00319209/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hermann Minkowski and the scandal of spacetime&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.535.6918&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Non-Euclidean Style of Minkowskian Relativity&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01234434/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s modern world&lt;/a>. There are some gems in Barrett&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hyperbolic Theory of Special Relativity&lt;/a>. Rhodes and Semon go into those tedious calculations in &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0501070" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relativistic velocity space, Wigner rotation and Thomas precession&lt;/a>. Tevian Dray&amp;rsquo;s textbook on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Special-Relativity-Tevian-Dray/dp/1466510471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Geometry of Special Relativity&lt;/a> from 2012 takes the hyperbolic viewpoint to teach special relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ungar probably has the most influential and extensive work in this space. His books on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrovector_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gyrovector space&lt;/a> present relativistic calculations in hyperbolic geometry from a solid group-theoretical viewpoint. Two of his relevant books are &lt;a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/6625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analytic Hyperbolic Geometry and Albert Einstein&amp;rsquo;s Special Theory of Relativity&lt;/a> from 2008 and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-306-47134-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond the Einstein Addition Law and its Gyroscopic Thomas Precession&lt;/a> from 2012. This work has even found applications in machine learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="beyond-special">Beyond special&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The hyperbolic view opens a new window to a universe beyond rewriting calculations in special relativity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hyperbolic geometry efficiently represents &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hierarchical relationships and complex networks&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08039" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nickel and Kiela&lt;/a> demonstrated in 2017 that hyperbolic geometry is better than Euclidean geometry when applying machine learning to complex data structures. In a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up paper&lt;/a>, they compared different hyperbolic models for learning hierarchical relationships and found that the Lorentz model is more efficient than the Poincaré model. Around the same time, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ganea, Bécigneul, and Hofmann&lt;/a> derived hyperbolic versions of deep learning tools by using Ungar&amp;rsquo;s gyrovector formalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These papers opened up a new research direction in machine learning on &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04562" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperbolic deep neural networks&lt;/a>. The researchers use tools developed specifically for special relativity, such as Lorentz transformations and gyrovector spaces, to improve machine learning algorithms. Physicists usually associate velocities and universal speed limits with Lorentz transformations. It is fascinating that Lorentz transformations arise in problems without a notion of motion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another application closer to my heart is hyperbolic geometry in general relativity. The spacetime of special relativity is special: we can identify Minkowski space with its tangent space which allows us to talk of spacetime events as four-vectors and apply global Lorentz transformations. These properties do not generalize to arbitrary Lorentzian manifolds. It&amp;rsquo;s not immediately evident that the hyperbolic viewpoint is still valuable when the spacetime is curved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we have seen above, Minkowski&amp;rsquo;s hyperboloid (\ref{2}) consists of points at unit proper distance from the origin. Hyperboloids are as natural in Minkowski space as spheres are in Euclidean space. So &lt;strong>hyperboloidal&lt;/strong> coordinates may be as natural in Lorentzian manifolds as spherical coordinates are in Riemannian manifolds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can we construct such hyperboloidal coordinates? In many applications, we need to separate spacetime into space and time. Let&amp;rsquo;s separate spacetime into hyperbolic space and time in non-Euclidean style. One approach is to take a hint from spherical coordinates. Generalize the hyperbola from (\ref{2}) to an arbitrary radius of curvature
$$ t^2-x^2 = \tau^2, $$
and use $\tau$ as a new coordinate. Setting $x=\tau \ \sinh \rho$ gives us the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milne universe&lt;/a> with metric
$$ ds^2 = -d\tau^2 + \tau^2 d\xi^2.$$
These coordinates have various use cases today, including &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum field theory&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holography&lt;/a>, and the theory of &lt;a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial differential equations&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another approach is to shift the hyperbola (\ref{2}) along the time direction by $\tau$ recognizing the special role of time
$$ (\tau - t)^2 - x^2 = 1 $$
Using $\tau$ as the new time coordinate, the Minkowski metric becomes
$$ ds^2 = -d\tau^2 + \frac{2x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} d\tau dx + \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx^2.$$
Level sets of $\tau$ are hyperbolic spaces. We can bring the metric into the more recognizable Poincaré form by the spatial transformation $x=2 \rho/(1-\rho^2)$.
$$ ds^2 = -d\tau^2 + \frac{4}{(1-\rho^2)^2} \left(2\rho d\tau d\rho + d\rho^2\right).$$
This construction generalizes to &lt;a href="../../publication/zenginoglu-2008-hyperboloidal/">curved spacetimes&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s favorable for numerically solving wave equations because the coefficients don&amp;rsquo;t depend on time. Some of the problems appearing in standard coordinates, such as the outer boundary and radiation extraction problems, &lt;a href="../../publication/zenginoglu-2011-hyperboloidal/">don&amp;rsquo;t arise with this approach&lt;/a> because we can solve the wave equation on the infinite spatial domain $\rho\in[0,1]$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hyperboloidal coordinates may seem unnatural at first, but that&amp;rsquo;s because we are used to thinking about space and time in Newtonian terms. Once you spend some time with them, you see that hyperboloidal coordinates are as valuable in Lorentzian manifolds as spherical coordinates are in Riemannian manifolds. I devoted most of my &lt;a href="../../publication/">work&lt;/a> exploring properties of these surfaces and I find their relation to special relativity fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperclusion">Hyperclusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Physics doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about how we make calculations in special relativity. The Wikipedia page for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lorentz_transformations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history of Lorentz transformations&lt;/a> lists many equivalent formalisms. We could keep the usual relativistic formulas using velocities and Lorentz factors, or employ &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_k-calculus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bondi&amp;rsquo;s $k$-calculus&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrovector_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ungar&amp;rsquo;s gyrovector space&lt;/a>. Why choose one over the other?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It may be just personal preference. How do you understand? I understand by analogy, so it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to me when formalisms lend themselves to connections to other fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is another, much more relevant reason to prefer the hyperbolic viewpoint. As scientists, we want powerful descriptions. The same thinking style should apply to a broad class of phenomena. In other words, we want to avoid overfitting our formalism to the phenomena at hand. Hyperbolic calculations translate into machine learning, spacetime curvature, and maybe other areas to be discovered. The non-Euclidean approach with hyperbolic angles seems more powerful than the usual approach with velocities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When physicists want to understand something, they consider idealizations and extremes. To understand spacetime then, consider black holes.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The black holes of nature are the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe:
the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chandrasekhar&lt;/a> (1983)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Black holes are simple with just two properties: mass and rotation. By dropping an object into a black hole, you can increase its mass and change its rotation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The simplicity of black holes contradicts the second law of thermodynamics, which states that &lt;em>total entropy never decreases&lt;/em>. If black holes are that simple, you can reduce total entropy by dropping a high-entropy object, say a hot teacup, into the black hole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wheeler&lt;/a>, best known for coining the term &amp;ldquo;black hole,&amp;rdquo; tasked one of his graduate students at Princeton, the young &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bekenstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bekenstein&lt;/a>, with resolving this paradox. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_general_relativity#Golden_age" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golden age&lt;/a> of relativity was in full swing around 1970, and Princeton was among the best places to be. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrios_Christodoulou" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christodoulou&lt;/a>, another student of Wheeler, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawking&lt;/a> had just shown that &lt;em>the area of a black hole horizon never decreases&lt;/em>. To resolve the entropy paradox, Bekenstein conjectured that black holes must have entropy and that the entropy must be proportional to the area of the black hole horizon in Planck units. The proportionality constant was determined by the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawking temperature&lt;/a>, which is why we call it the &lt;a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein-Hawking_entropy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bekenstein-Hawking&lt;/a> Black-Hole entropy
$$ S_{BH} = \frac{A}{4 L_P^2}$$
where $A$ is the horizon area, $L_P$ is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planck length&lt;/a>, $S$ stands for entropy (probably after &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_L%C3%A9onard_Sadi_Carnot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sadi Carnot&lt;/a>), and BH stands for &lt;a href="#brief-history-of-bekenstein-hawking-black-hole-entropy">Brief History&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may think this is a curious result about curious objects called black holes with little relevance to our notion of spacetime. But consider the following question: what is the maximum entropy in a finite, say spherical region? If you take some high-entropy matter and squeeze it spherically (with your mind), eventually, you hit the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the compressed matter forms a black hole. This thought experiment leads to the surprising conclusion that the entropy of any matter system is bound by the surface area of the smallest sphere that encloses it&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started with black holes and arrived at the&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="holographic-principle">Holographic Principle&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Counterintuitively, the maximal entropy of a region scales with the area of its boundary, not its volume. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holographic principle&lt;/a> pushes this area-dependence further, suggesting that the dynamics in a volume of space is encoded on the boundary of that space. In other words, the information content of a spacetime region is encoded on the surface of that region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take a break and think about this for a moment. How can our three-dimensional world be encoded on a two-dimensional surface? What does it mean? Is the universe a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game&lt;/a> running on the screen of an alien child? Are we trapped in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Matrix&lt;/a>? Are we &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nqcL0mjMjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Livin&amp;rsquo; on the Edge&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The most famous realization of the holographic principle is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdS/CFT correspondence&lt;/a>. Conjectured by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Mart%C3%ADn_Maldacena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maldacena&lt;/a> in 1997, the correspondence suggests an equivalence between a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">string theory&lt;/a> in curved anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS) and a strongly coupled &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conformal field theory&lt;/a> in a lower-dimensional flat spacetime. Aside from the details, the remarkable aspect of the conjecture is the duality between the bulk and the boundary of AdS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is a visual image for the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. The cylinder represents the three-dimensional AdS$_3$ spacetime. On the boundary of the cylinder lives the 1+1 dimensional CFT$_2$. Slices of constant time are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_manifold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperbolic manifolds&lt;/a> with negative curvature, drawn as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poincaré disks&lt;/a>. A gravity theory within the disks is dual to a gravity-free theory on the bounding circle. The boundary of space encodes the bulk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The negative curvature of AdS is a feature and a bug. It allows the realization of the holographic principle due to its hyperbolic slices, but it also makes AdS an unphysical model for our universe. At cosmological scales, the universe has positive curvature and resembles de Sitter space. At astrophysical and smaller scales, isolated systems are modeled by asymptotically flat spacetimes. Either way, anti-de Sitter spacetime, with all its &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bizarre&lt;/a> features, is not a good model for physical reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can we establish the holographic principle for isolated systems?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hyperbolic-hyperboloidal">Hyperbolic Hyperboloidal&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Consider the AdS$_3$ metric in static coordinates with curvature scale $L$
$$ ds^2_{\rm{AdS}} = - \left(L^2+r^2\right) d\tau^2 + \textcolor{RedViolet}{\frac{L^2}{L^2+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2},$$
Slices of constant time are hyperbolic spaces with negative curvature. Hyperbolic geometry has much more space near its conformal boundary than Euclidean space. It seems that flat spacetime with its Euclidean time slices and vanishing curvature would not allow such a description
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 . $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But now consider the time-shifted spacetime hyperboloid with curvature radius $L$
$$ (\tau-t)^2 - r^2 = L^2 $$
This hypersurface is spacelike everywhere and extends to null infinity. Such surfaces are called hyperboloidal. Solving for $\tau$, we choose the negative square root, so the surfaces extend to future null infinity.
$$ \tau = t - \sqrt{L^2+r^2}.$$
In this hyperboloidal time, Minkowski metric has hyperbolic spatial slices
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 - \frac{2 r}{\sqrt{L^2+r^2}} d\tau dr + \textcolor{RedViolet}{\frac{L^2}{L^2+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2}. $$
Just like AdS, flat spacetime takes the form of hyperbolic space with a time direction. You can draw the spacetime geometry as a cylinder, which is what Penrose did in his first publication on conformal infinity in 1963.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The agreement of the geometry of hyperboloidal and AdS slices is suggestive. Calculations in the AdS/CFT literature performed on time slices may carry over to flat spacetime in hyperboloidal coordinates. One such example is the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rt-if-you-agree">RT if you agree&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ryu and Takayanagi (RT) have &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0603001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed&lt;/a> a relation between geometry in AdS and entropy in CFT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One can interpret the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as a measure of information lost to external observers. The black-hole horizon acts as a screen dividing space into two subsystems inside and outside the horizon. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_of_entanglement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entanglement entropy&lt;/a> is proportional to the area of this screen. The RT conjecture relates the entanglement entropy on CFT to the surface area of a screen in AdS that divides the AdS boundary into subdomains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Words don&amp;rsquo;t do it justice, so let&amp;rsquo;s look at a picture. Below is a diagram from the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0603001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RT paper&lt;/a> for AdS$_3$ /CFT$_2$.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two subsystems $A$ and $B$ of CFT$_2$ live on the boundary of AdS$_3$. They are separated by a screen $\gamma_A$ required to be an extremal surface in the bulk AdS$_3$. An extremal &amp;ldquo;surface&amp;rdquo; on a slice of AdS$_3$ is a geodesic line connecting the meeting points of the domains $A$ and $B$ on the bounding circle. The RT proposal states that the entanglement entropy of subsystem $A$ is proportional to the area of the screen $\gamma_A$:
$$ S_A \sim \rm{Area\ of\ }\gamma_A $$
In this case, we are talking about the length of a geodesic on a time slice. You can easily see that the calculation does not change whether you are in AdS or hyperboloidal Minkowski. In the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu%E2%80%93Takayanagi_conjecture#Example" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example on Wikipedia&lt;/a>, the AdS$_3$ metric is written in the spatial coordinate $\rho$ defined through $r=\sinh \rho$, so
$$ ds^2_{\rm{AdS}} = -\cosh^2\rho\ d\tau^2 + \textcolor{Blue}{d\rho^2 + \sinh^2\rho\ d\theta^2}. $$
The same spatial geometry is obtained in hyperboloidal coordinates in Minkowski&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 - \sinh\rho\ d\tau d\rho + \textcolor{Blue}{d\rho^2 + \sinh^2\rho\ d\theta^2}. $$
This flat metric describes a stack of hyperbolic disks, just like the AdS metric. The length of the geodesic and its relation to entanglement entropy are the same in hyperboloidal coordinates. The original RT proposal applies directly to flat spacetime!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RT proposal reveals an interesting interpretation for the area dependence of entropy. It is easier to understand that entanglement entropy should be proportional to the area of a screen and not to the volume behind it. But maybe we should ask first: What is volume?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thinking-outside-the-ball">Thinking outside the ball&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When we think of volume, we typically envision a box or a ball and consider the space inside. Relativity modifies our intuition about space and time, so it is reasonable that our notion of volume is modified as well. The volume of a region $B$ is the integral of the volume form
$$ V_B = \int_{B} \sqrt{\det h} \ d\Sigma, $$
and depends on the spatial metric $h$. In flat space we have $\sqrt{\det h} =$ $r^2 \sin\theta$. The volume of a ball of radius $R$ gives us the usual formula that we memorize at school
$$ V_{B(R)} = \int_{0}^{R} \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} r^2 \sin\theta \ dr d\theta d\varphi= 4\pi \int_{0}^{R} r^2 dr = \frac{4\pi}{3}R^3. $$
For the hyperboloidal foliation with $L=1$ we have
$$ h = \frac{1}{1+r^2}dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta d\varphi^2,\quad \sqrt{\det h} = \frac{r^2 \sin\theta}{\sqrt{1+r^2}}. $$
The volume expression changes to
$$ V_{B(R)} = 4\pi \int_{0}^{R} \frac{r^2}{\sqrt{1+r^2}} dr. $$
We can get a sense for it using Taylor expansions. For small spheres with $R \ll 1$, we get the usual result
$$ V_{B(R)}=\frac{4\pi}{3}R^3+O(R^5).$$
For large spheres, however, the series expansion for $R\gg 1$ gives
$$ V_{B(R)}=2\pi R^2 + O(\ln R).$$
Remarkably, volume and area scale the same way near the asymptotic boundary in hyperboloidal coordinates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are suggestive observations about the potential usefulness of hyperboloidal surfaces in holography. And indeed, there is a current effort using hyperboloidal surfaces for holography.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="celestial-holography">Celestial Holography&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the context of quantum gravity, the holographic principle suggests duality between a gravity theory in the bulk and a quantum theory on the boundary. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celestial holography&lt;/a> suggests that asymptotically flat spacetimes are dual to a theory living on the &amp;ldquo;celestial sphere&amp;rdquo; at infinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The theory uses Bondi coordinates along null infinity to discuss asymptotic symmetries, and switches to a hyperboloidal slicing to discuss massive particles. The slices they use have been first proposed as a cosmological model by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milne_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milne&lt;/a> in 1935. Milne slices are level sets of
$$ \tau^2 = t^2 - r^2.$$
Introducing the spatial coordinate
$$ \rho = \frac{r}{\sqrt{t^2-r^2}}, $$
the Minkowski metric takes the form
$$ ds^2_{\rm{Mink}} = -d\tau^2 + \tau^2 \left( \textcolor{RedViolet}{\frac{1}{1+\rho^2} d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\sigma^2}\right). $$
Again, we recognize the representation of Minkowski spacetime as a stack of hyperbolic disks. But in this case, the metric coefficients depend on time $\tau$. And the mean extrinsic curvature of Milne slices vanishes asymptotically in time as $K=3/\tau$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suspect that the hyperboloidal foliation we discussed &lt;a href="#hyperbolic-hyperboloidal">above&lt;/a> is better than Milne slicing for holography. Consider the Penrose diagram of Milne slices.

The Penrose diagram and the metric reveal some undesirable features of Milne slices compared to the hyperboloidal foliation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The slices intersect at null infinity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The coordinates are time-dependent.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no analog of the AdS curvature scale.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In contrast, the hyperboloidal foliation has constant mean curvature, $K=3/L$, playing the same role as the curvature scale in AdS geometry. The coordinates are independent of time and provide a smooth foliation of null infinity. Below are Penrose diagrams for such hyperboloidal, constant-mean-curvature foliations with different values of the mean extrinsic curvature, which acts as a dial between characteristic and Cauchy surfaces.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Milne coordinates have one advantage that a hyperboloidal foliation of null infinity cannot provide. A massive particle in constant motion will asymptote to a point on the Milne slices. Dirac used this property in his 1949 paper on &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forms of Relativistic Dynamics&lt;/a> and it appears repeatedly in celestial holography. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how important this is. But Milne coordinates are also hyperboloidal. So in that sense, celestial holography is already using hyperboloidal holography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Celestial holography is relatively new and developing rapidly. We don&amp;rsquo;t know how the final version will look like. That&amp;rsquo;s the excitement of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap up&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A few curious observations suggest that hyperboloidal coordinates are interesting for holography.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Flat spacetime becomes a stack of hyperbolic disks, with a &lt;a href="#hyperbolic-hyperboloidal">cylinder&lt;/a> representing the global picture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The original &lt;a href="#rt-if-you-agree">Ryu-Takayanagi calculations&lt;/a> apply to Minkowski spacetime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="#thinking-outside-the-ball">Volume scales as area&lt;/a> near the conformal boundary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spacetime hyperboloids are essential in &lt;a href="#celestial-holography">celestial holography&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Are these observations indicative of a profound duality, an underlying realization of the holographic principle for isolated systems in hyperboloidal coordinates? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. The similarity between Minkowski in hyperboloidal coordinates and AdS is interesting, but it can also be misleading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The observations here are, by their very nature, coordinate-dependent. Suitable coordinates may ease calculations and suggest research directions, but the results should not depend on them. A significant, coordinate-independent difference to the AdS case is the null conformal boundary of asymptotically flat spacetimes. Any realization of the holographic principle will need to incorporate the null boundary and the associated &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi%E2%80%93Metzner%E2%80%93Sachs_group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">symmetries&lt;/a> as celestial holography is attempting to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can be misleading to take similarities in specific coordinates too far, but it can also be a missed opportunity to ignore them. I think hyperbolic geometry and hyperboloidal surfaces will keep playing an essential role in holography. &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Watch%20this%20Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch this space!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

When presenting my work, I often encounter the objection that infinity is not physical. But not all infinities are created equal, and some are more physical than others. In fact, we can &lt;strong>verify by experiment&lt;/strong> that we are at infinity with respect to distant sources of radiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below I collect some thoughts on infinity and describe the experiment. Feel free to skip my ramblings and go directly to the &lt;a href="#a-thought-experiment">experiment&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-dont-need-no-infinity">We don&amp;rsquo;t need no infinity&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Physicists are generally uncomfortable with infinity. First, it is argued, infinity cannot be the outcome of a physical experiment. Second, infinity as the outcome of a calculation indicates problems with the theory. Resolving such problems is important because they may reveal new research directions such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renormalization techniques&lt;/a>. Since infinity doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense in experiment and should be avoided in theory, physicists are skeptical when it appears in mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena. A few examples: Max Tegmark argues that infinity is an idea that should be &lt;a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retired from physics&lt;/a>; Nicolas Gisin aims to &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/does-time-really-flow-new-clues-come-from-a-century-old-approach-to-math-20200407/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">understand time&lt;/a> without relying on infinitely precise numbers; and here is a quote from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0238-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The physics of infinity&lt;/a> by Ellis, Meissner, and Nicolai:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We maintain that in each physical case where $\infty$ is used in a discussion, greater insight is attained by considering what large number $N$ will suffice instead because real physics is embodied in that number.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This uneasiness of physicists with infinity is also present in mathematics. There are mathematical philosophies and formalisms without infinity, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finitism&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intuitionism&lt;/a>. I was attracted to similar ideas when I was in college, so I went down the rabbit hole of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fuzzy numbers&lt;/a>. They seemed to &amp;ldquo;naturally&amp;rdquo; represent physical measurements, which are not real numbers with infinite precision but fuzzy numbers with uncertainties. The more I learned about fuzzy numbers, however, the less I was convinced of their general utility. They were cumbersome and did not improve calculations in most cases. I learned, by way of fuzzy numbers, that successful mathematical representations do not necessarily match our physical intuitions. The map is not the territory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="empirical-infinity">Empirical infinity&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Aristotle distinguishes &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_infinity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two notions of infinity&lt;/a>: actual and potential. Potential infinity is what children learn first: numbers just keep going &amp;ldquo;forever&amp;rdquo;. Actual infinity is the completion of this process: the set of all numbers as a mathematical object.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We do not observe infinity directly but we use it to represent our impressions of the natural world. In a painting, both sides of a road may meet at a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_point" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanishing point&lt;/a>. The road ends somewhere but the painting suggests that the meeting point is beyond the horizon of perception. The representation of &amp;ldquo;far&amp;rdquo; on the canvas is infinity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The infinity on the canvas is neither potential (it&amp;rsquo;s a finite, completed representation of infinity) nor actual (the horizon is actually at a finite distance). Call it empirical infinity. Empirical concepts are abstracted from individual perceptions. Empirical infinity is the best canvas representation of your perception looking down a long, seemingly unending road. You don&amp;rsquo;t know how far you can see, and you don&amp;rsquo;t care about representing that particular detail in your painting. You just want to express that it&amp;rsquo;s very far.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-thought-experiment">A thought experiment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Black hole perturbations have a property that is different at infinity and at a finite distance. We can use this property to determine where we are with respect to the black hole. We would need very accurate detectors to measure it, which we don&amp;rsquo;t have yet, so consider this a reasonable thought experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perturbations of a black hole go through an oscillatory period, and subsequently decay with a power-law $ \sim t^p$, where $t$ is time as measured by the observer and $p$ is the negative power&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Surprisingly, the power $p$ is different depending on where you observe the perturbations: -3 at finite distances, -2 at infinity&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The slower decay at infinity is somewhat unexpected. One could argue that the power-law decay, which was first discovered for finite distances, should be non-radiative; it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be detected at infinity. As demonstrated by Gundlach, Price, and Pullin in 1994, it is not only radiative but decays slower at infinity than at finite distances&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. There are explanations of this slower decay in terms of accumulation of backscattering off of curvature towards infinity, but this is not our main concern&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Given that the rates at finite distances and infinity are different, we ask the following question:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Which decay rate would we observe?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are clearly a finite distance away from the black hole, so the intuitive answer is that we would measure the finite distance rate. However, the correct answer is the infinity rate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is a figure from a &lt;a href="https://anilzen.github.io/publication/zenginoglu-2008-tail/">paper of mine&lt;/a> where I studied various decay rates. The figure shows the evolution of the decay rate in time for various distances to the black hole.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The long-time decay rate is -3 for any finite distance as the theory demonstrates. But the theory is valid for the asymptotic limit. Initially, the decay rate for distant observers is much closer to -2 than to -3. The top curve in the figure is the measurement at infinity, and the next closest curve is at 40,000 units of black hole mass (in these units, a solar mass corresponds to a distance of 1.5 km). For a small black hole of 5 solar masses, this observer is about 300,000 km away. This may sound far, but it&amp;rsquo;s just one light second, which is about the distance between the Earth and the Moon. To compare, typical sources of gravitational waves are thousands and millions of light years away. The decay rate of perturbations from such a distant source would be indistinguishable from the infinity value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Infinity in astrophysics may be closer than the Moon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If we ever get to measure the power-law decay from black-hole perturbations, we will measure the infinity value and not the finite distance value, even though we are a finite distance away from the sources. Given that the distances are literally astronomical, it&amp;rsquo;s more practical to use infinity both in our calculations and in our discussions where it&amp;rsquo;s needed, instead of artificially avoiding it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think most people agree that actual infinity doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the real world. But the number 3 also doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the real world. Numbers are useful concepts abstracted from observations and represented in mathematical models. The decay rate experiment demonstrates that infinity is a useful concept in describing astrophysical observations. We should embrace empirical infinity and its appearance in our formalisms as long as it improves our calculations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The observation of a radiative field at infinity gives the part of the field that falls off as $1/r$. In other words, for a radiative field $\phi$, its observation at infinity is $\lim_{r\to\infty} r \phi$.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For those of you who are wondering about the mathematical form of such a function, here is an example:
$$ \phi(t,r) \sim \frac{C_1}{(C_2+t+r)(C_3+t-r)^2} $$
The constants $C_i$ are arbitrary values determined by the initial perturbation. For fixed $r$ we have $\phi\sim 1/t^3$. Along null directions with constant $t+r$, the function decays as $\phi\sim 1/(t-r)^2$. Therefore, an observer measures the decay rate $3$ or $2$ depending on location.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
