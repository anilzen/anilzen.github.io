In this project, I explore this idea.\nIn a certain sense, I argue that a choice of time provides a natural representation of physical fields. The geometry of space is hyperbolic. We live in one of Escher’s drawings representing hyperbolic space.\nThis is clearly nonsensical heresy. Covariance under diffeomorphisms is a fundamental principle of general relativity. What does it mean that a certain choice of time is natural?\nHere is the argument. The time evolution of certain physical observables does depend on foliation. For example, the ADM mass computed on Euclidean slices is constant under time evolution. The Bondi mass computed on hyperboloidal and null slices, however, decays due to radiation of energy to infinity. The Bondi mass is a more natural observable than the ADM mass.\nConsider a far away observer of a quantum system. In the mathematical idealization of this scenario, such an observer sits on future null infinity and “looks down” the null cone to observe the quantum system. The spacelike surface that this observer constructs as a surface of simultaneity will necessarily be hyperboloidal. Therefore, it seems reasonable to describe quantum fields on hyperboloidal surfaces.\nIn such a scenario, the idea that quantum fields are a bunch of harmonic oscillators goes away. Instead, we have damped oscillators with a complex term. Waves are stretched out towards infinity. The spatial wavelength of a quantum wave in this description is not constant, but becomes unbounded as the field extends to the observer.\nThe holographic principle The spatial geometry of the Minkowski metric in hyperboloidal coordinates matches exactly the spatial geometry of the Anti-de Sitter metric in standard coordinates. I wrote about this observation two years ago in a blog post. Back then, I thought this was a known curiosity, but there seem to be other advantages of this approach to holography. I’m now exploring this idea with the help of the NSF award. It’s more speculative than my usual work, but it’s been fun to venture into this unfamiliar territory.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1ba4e54c32d0393af6c75a725d45e1c","permalink":"https://anilzen.github.io/research/hyperboloidal-holography/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/hyperboloidal-holography/","section":"research","summary":"The remarkable success of the hyperboloidal approach in representing propagating fields in the exterior of isolated systems suggests that it may be a useful tool for the study of quantum fields.","tags":[],"title":"Hyperboloidal Holography","type":"research"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"042ecc7f423a5850c801567d90e6d740","permalink":"https://anilzen.github.io/research/numerical-optimization/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/numerical-optimization/","section":"research","summary":"Swarm-based optimization for non-convex functions","tags":[],"title":"Numerical Optimization","type":"research"},{"authors":["Anıl Zenginoğlu"],"categories":null,"content":"The problem with the standard definition Wikipedia defines quantum mechanics (QM) as “a fundamental theory that describes the behavior of nature at and below the scale of atoms.” Britannica defines it as the “science dealing with the behavior of matter and light on the atomic and subatomic scale.” Many other sources and textbooks define QM as the physics of the very small.\nThe problem with this definition is simple: it’s wrong.\nMacroscopic quantum systems We cannot define QM as the physics of the very small because there are macroscopic systems that show quantum behavior. When I was studying theoretical physics in Vienna, one of the hottest topics of discussion was Zeilinger’s experiment demonstrating the wave–particle duality of C$_{60}$ molecules. Zeilinger, who received the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for his research on quantum entanglement, was pushing the limits of quantum behavior. A molecule of 60 carbon atoms is enormous compared to inhabitants of the subatomic scale, such as electrons and photons typically used to demonstrate interferometry. The lead author of the C$_{60}$-paper, Markus Arndt, pushed the limit further, demonstrating quantum interference for large organic molecules. In one experiment, they put molecules consisting of 2,000 atoms into quantum superposition.\nThere is no theoretical limit to the scale where quantum behavior occurs. If there were, we wouldn’t have a multi-billion dollar industry and a global quantum race trying to build the largest quantum computer.\nIt’s well-known that macroscopic quantum systems exist. There is even a Wikipedia page on macroscopic quantum phenomena. The best-known examples are superconductors and superfluids.\nIn a superconductor, pairs of electrons (Cooper pairs) occupy the same quantum state described by a single, coherent quantum wavefunction extending over macroscopic distances. Superconducting magnets in MRI machines or in particle accelerators are big (meters to kilometers) and heavy (tons).\nIn a superfluid, the particles share a single quantum wave function. Laboratory superfluids are relatively small but there are applications where several hundreds of superfluid helium are used.\nThe most obviously macroscopic quantum objects are astrophysical. Neutron stars weigh more than the Sun. The nucleons in a neutron star form Cooper pairs leading to superfluidity and superconductivity.\nMost impressively, black holes exhibit quantum behavior. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, $S_{BH}$, of a black hole is given as the event horizon surface area, $A$, counted in units of Planck area, $\\ell_P^2$, $$ S_{BH} = \\frac{A}{\\ell_P^2} \\frac{k_B}{4}, \\qquad \\mathrm{where} \\qquad \\ell_P^2 = \\frac{\\hbar G}{c^3}. $$ Given that entropy measures information, this equation suggests that a black hole functions as a quantum device, storing the information about the matter and energy that have fallen into it. Black holes saturate the theoretical storage limit of quantum information for a region of space.\nBlack holes can be as large as our entire solar system with billions of solar masses. Clearly, the definition of quantum mechanics as the physics of the very small does not apply here.\nOther attempts at a better definition A definition that’s not blatantly wrong is given in the “Introduction to quantum mechanics” by David Morin\nQuantum mechanics can be thought of roughly as the study of physics on very small length scales, although there are also certain macroscopic systems it directly applies to. The descriptor “quantum” arises because in contrast with classical mechanics, certain quantities take on only discrete values. However, some quantities still take on continuous values.\nIndeed, we can roughly think of QM as the study of physics on very small scales with the caveats given. But the caveats are confusing. We’re invited to think of QM as the physics of the very small but learn that it also applies to macroscopic systems. Some quantities are discrete, hence the name quantum, but others are continuous. What is it then?\nIt’s more descriptive to define quantum mechanics through the behavior of quantum objects, such as superposition, entanglement, decoherence, and wave-particle duality1. Unfortunately, this definition smells of a tautology: quantum is what acts quantum. One would like to know when these quantum behaviors arise in contrast to the classical world we’re used to. How should we relate our understanding of the classical world to the magical realm of quantumania?\nA better definition A good definition should outline a rough boundary between classical and quantum behavior. Historically, we discovered quantum mechanics by studying the mechanics of small things like atoms and photons. We now know, however, that the relevant boundary is not scale. It’s environmental coupling.\nQuantum mechanics is the study of systems whose environmental coupling is relatively weak.\nThis definition shifts the focus from scale to the system’s interaction with its environment.

Using standard numerical methods, I demonstrate a technique called hyperboloidal compactification to solve unbounded-domain wave equations directly (no truncation, no artificial boundaries) by mapping the unbounded domain to a finite domain.\nCode for the demonstrations uses public libraries and is available as a Google Colab notebook so that you can run everything from a browser.\nWhy waves? Our most important senses, sight and sound, rely on waves. Electromagnetic and acoustic waves carry information from an external reality far from the immediate neighborhood of our body to our audiovisual system. Our current understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe is based on waves. Quantum field theory models all elementary particles as wave-like excitations of quantum fields. Most remarkably, we have recently gained the ability to detect gravitational waves, or spacetime waves, from the most energetic phenomena in the Universe happening billions of light years away.\nThe ability to understand waves by solving the equations that describe them is essential also for practical applications, such as modeling of earthquakes (seismology), ocean waves and tsunamis (oceanography), sonar systems (acoustics), radar scattering off airplanes and antenna design (electromagnetism), among others.\nBut you probably didn’t need that motivation if you’re reading this.\nThe mathematical model The simplest equation that describes a wave is aptly named the wave equation. We’ll consider the case with one space dimension $$ \\left(-\\partial_t^2 + \\partial_x^2\\right) u(x,t) = 0. \\tag{1} \\label{1}$$ The acceleration (or curvature in time), $\\partial_t^2$, is bced by the curvature in space, $\\partial_x^2$. This delicate balance leads to solutions that propagate while maintaining their form. In one dimension, there are only two directions a wave can propagate, and we get the general solution $$ u(x,t) = f_+(x-t) + f_-(x+t). $$ The functions $f_\\pm$ travel unchanged along the curves $x\\pm t$. We call these curves characteristics. The characteristics extend infinitely in both directions.\nWe solved \\eqref{1} explicitly, but more interesting wave equations cannot be solved like this. They include higher dimensions, varying coefficients, potential terms, source functions, nonlinearities, etc. For those cases, we use numerical methods.\nBut there’s a problem. The wave equation is posed on a spatially unbounded domain, $x\\in(-\\infty, \\infty)$1. Before we can solve the equation numerically, we need to decide what to do with the unbounded domain.\nWhy boundaries? An argument that one finds in some textbooks and papers is that computational resources are finite, so we must truncate the solution domain artificially to some $x\\in(-L, L)$ with $L$ suitably large. We then apply boundary conditions to the solution.\nThis artificial truncation creates two problems:\nboundary treatment, and radiation extraction. The construction of boundary conditions for wave equations has been its own research direction since the 1970s, with thousands of papers written on the problem. The corresponding conditions have names such as absorbing, transparent, non-reflecting, or radiative2. Due to the difficulty of the problem, people also constructed damping layers, which are not boundary conditions but layers of artificial dissipation that absorb the wave, such as the perfectly matched layer.\nEven when you have a somewhat satisfactory treatment of the boundary, you still don’t have access to the full solution. The full solution, however, is relevant when you’re interested in the radiative fields that are defined at infinity. Whether you want to calculate radar cross-sections of airplanes or gravitational waves from black holes, you need to know the solution at infinity.\nThen why don’t we solve the full problem on the full domain? The argument of finite computational resources is clearly wrong. We can map the unbounded domain to a bounded domain. Let’s see how that doesn’t work.\nSpatial compactification There are many options to map the infinite domain $x\\in(-\\infty,\\infty)$ to a finite domain in some other coordinate, $\\rho$. A well-known option is the tangens function: $x = \\tan \\rho$ with $\\rho\\in[-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]$3. You can also perform an algebraic compactification, $x=\\rho/(1-\\rho^2)$, or use the hyperbolic tangent, $x=\\mathrm{arctanh}\\ \\rho$ with $\\rho\\in[-1,1]$. The basic idea is to map the infinite domain $x$ to a compact domain in $\\rho$ and then solve the wave equation numerically on this finite, compact domain.\nIt sounds obvious and, indeed, has been tried in the 1970s4. The problem is that solutions oscillate out to infinity. The spatial mapping converts an unbounded domain problem to an unbounded oscillation problem, and we gain nothing.\nConsider a sine-wave solution to the wave equation, $u(x,t) = \\sin(x-t)$.

Misner passed on July 24, 2023, and there was a lovely memorial symposium at the University of Maryland on November 11, 2023, to celebrate his life. Misner was a prolific scientist who significantly influenced the early developments of general relativity during its first golden age. His last three submissions on the arXiv are on hyperboloidal compactification, a rather niche topic in relativity that happens to be my research area, so I wrote this post about it.\nThe symposium gave an excellent overview of Misner’s work and provided some insight into his character. Misner is most widely known as the “M” in MTW and ADM1. One cannot possibly discuss every topic that Misner influenced in a single day, so, inevitably, some of his research areas were left out; among them was his work on hyperboloidal methods. Below are Misner’s last three submissions on the arXiv.\nHyperboloidal Slices and Artificial Cosmology for Numerical Relativity (2004) published as part of Deserfest, Over the Rainbow: Numerical Relativity beyond Scri+ (2005), Excising das All: Evolving Maxwell waves beyond scri with James R. van Meter and David R. Fiske (2006) published in PRD. Misner’s main idea is to add an artificial cosmological constant to the Einstein equations to help with hyperboloidal compactification. Below, I will discuss his idea in two sections.\nFirst, the coordinates. Misner proposes a hyperboloidal compactification in the toy model of de Sitter spacetime to demonstrate his idea. The coordinates he proposes are, in my opinion, not particularly useful. We now have a good understanding of hyperboloidal compactification that wasn’t available then. I will discuss his coordinates based on our current understanding.\nSecond, the artificial cosmological constant. Misner proposes to modify the Einstein equations with a small cosmological constant to stabilize hyperboloidal evolution. This is a very interesting and promising idea that, to my knowledge, has never been tried before.\nThe coordinates The main construction is clearly laid out in Misner’s first paper prepared for the celebration of his long-time collaborator Stanley Deser. The other papers are commentary, demonstration, and further development.\nBefore discussing the coordinates, we’ll review our current understanding of hyperboloidal regularization of coordinate singularities to put Misner’s construction in context.\nSpacelike regularization of coordinate singularities Take a spherically symmetric, stationary spacetime. For brevity, we’ll ignore the spherical part of the spacetime and discuss only the $\\{t,r\\}$ plane. We write the metric as $$ ds^2 = - f(r) dt^2 + \\frac{1}{f(r)} dr^2. $$ We get Minkowski with $f=1$, Schwarzschild with $f=1-\\frac{2M}{r}$, or de Sitter with $ f = 1-\\frac{r^2}{L^2}$. There’s a (coordinate) singularity where $f$ vanishes: the event horizon of Schwarzschild at $r=2M$ or the cosmological horizon of de Sitter at $r=L$. From the conformal point of view, spatial infinity is also a coordinate singularity, but it’s not visible on the metric without compactification.\nAfter decades of confusion following Schwarzschild’s first publication of the Schwarzschild metric, we now know that a suitable re-slicing of spacetime (a different definition of time) resolves such coordinate singularities. There are many different ways to do this, but, especially for numerics, we’d like to maintain the time symmetry of the background when introducing a new time function. Otherwise, the coefficients of the transformed metric depend on time. The time symmetry is respected by transformations of the form $$ \\tau = t + h(r).$$ The function $h(r)$ is called the height function because it describes the height of the new coordinate $\\tau$ with respect to $t$ when plotted on the $\\{t,r\\}$ plane. This transformation leaves the time derivatives invariant as intended: $\\partial_t = \\partial_\\tau$. The metric becomes $$ ds^2 = - f d\\tau^2 + 2 f H \\ d\\tau dr + \\frac{1-f^2 H^2}{f} dr^2, $$ where we have defined $H:=dh/dr$. Regularization refers to choosing a suitable $H$ such that the $rr$-component of the above metric is regular at the zeros of $f$. This requirement implies $fH \\sim \\pm 1$ at those zeros. Spacelike regularization ensures that $\\tau$ is a time coordinate with spacelike level sets, which implies $|fH|\u0026lt;1$ away from the zeros of $f$. The sign of $H$ determines the orientation with respect to the null cone: whether we resolve the white hole or the black hole, past null infinity or future null infinity. If you compare the time transformation above with the null coordinates, $u=t-r$ and $v=t+r$, you can see that the slicing resembles outgoing null rays, $u$, for $H\u0026lt;0$ and ingoing null rays, $v$, for $H\u0026gt;0$.\nHyperboloidal coordinates provide a spacelike regularization of the coordinate singularity for the conformal metric at spatial infinity.

The hows and whys, the fundamentals and principles, “whether or not the world has three dimensions,” all boil down to one question: Can you predict the future?\nPredicting the future for a physicist is, of course, a much more accurate undertaking than for fortune tellers, astrologers, or economists. We want to know what happens to well-defined variables describing the mathematical idealization of a natural system given a snapshot in time1.\nWe call this process “solving an initial value problem.” We solve an equation of motion, typically a partial differential equation (PDE), with prescribed initial data. The PDE is the mathematical idealization of our model of the physical system under consideration. That’s where all the whys and hows go. The PDE describes how the chosen variables of the system vary in relation to each other. The initial data is the snapshot of these variables at a given time. The solution to this initial value problem is our prediction of the future.\nThe language of a snapshot in time distinguishes time and space. But didn’t special relativity teach us that time by itself and space by itself are mere shadows? Well, it did, and it didn’t. Special relativity taught us that the notion of time and simultaneity is observer-dependent. But time is still a special dimension in a relativistic spacetime, distinct from its spatial friends. You can already see at the level of the metric signature, $(-+++)$, that time is special.\nTo formulate an initial value problem, we need to split spacetime into space and time. In relativity, there are three approaches to splitting spacetime to formulate an initial value problem: Cauchy, characteristic, and hyperboloidal. Let’s take the flat, 1+1 dimensional spacetime to demonstrate these approaches. In standard coordinates $(t,r)$, the flat metric reads $$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 \\tag{1} \\label{1} $$ The most intuitive approach is to take the snapshot at $t=0$. The corresponding surface2 is called a Cauchy surface and has specific desirable properties that generalize to more interesting cases. The associated Cauchy problem plays a central role in mathematical and numerical relativity.\nWe also have null surfaces in relativity, named as such because they provide the nullspace of the metric \\eqref{1} through $t\\pm r$. This null cone is fundamental in many aspects. First, it determines the causal structure of spacetime. Second, it describes the propagation of disturbances. In particular, massless fields propagate along the null cone. Even before the advent of relativity, it was known that disturbances to solutions of wave equations propagate along these special surfaces called characteristics. One can provide data on such characteristic surfaces and solve a characteristic evolution problem. This approach is particularly valuable in the modern era of gravitational-wave astronomy because gravitational waves are only defined at infinity along outgoing null directions.\nHyperboloidal surfaces The hyperboloidal approach is the odd one. You take a spacetime hyperboloid, say $t^2 - r^2 = 1,$ and give initial data on the surface defined by $t(r) = \\sqrt{1+r^2}.$ This construction seems weird and arbitrary when you first encounter it. Why would you do something like this? How is this surface a snapshot? Why not pick another transformation?\nMany relativists feel that hyperboloidal surfaces are somewhat unnatural, lacking the simplicity and elegance of the Cauchy or characteristic approaches. Below, I demonstrate how hyperboloidal surfaces extend the mathematical notion of a sphere to relativity and satisfy a physical principle. The concepts that we’ll encounter will lead us to speculations in the quantum realm.\nMathematical notion Hyperboloids as analogs of spheres in spacetime.\nA spacetime hyperboloid. Time’s up. A circle is a set of points equidistant from a given point. This definition is among the purest in mathematics3. To derive the equation for a circle, consider the Euclidean metric in two dimensions $$ ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2. $$ The set of points $\\{x,y\\}$ at distance $R$ from the origin satisfies $$ x^2 + y^2 = R^2. $$ The circle (or sphere in three dimensions) is the simplest nontrivial example of a constant curvature surface, with its curvature being the reciprocal of its radius, $K=1/R$. Now, let’s consider the corresponding object in relativity.\nWhat is the set of events equidistant from a given event?\nIn the relativistic setting, spacetime distance is proper time. Using the metric \\eqref{1}, the set of events $\\{t, r\\}$ at proper time $T$ from the origin satisfies $$ - t^2 + r^2 = \\pm T^2. $$ This equation describes a spacetime hyperbola. The sign in the equation determines whether the hyperbola is spacelike or timelike4. We’ll pick the negative sign for the spacelike hyperbola because we aim to construct a snapshot.

Entropy increases, we get older, and we die. Mark Thompson, New Yorker Magazine This perception of entropy, prevalent in popular culture, presents it as the driving force for decay and disorder. But this cannot be the whole story. The incredible abundance of life on our planet would not have been possible without the self-organization of complex systems. The story of entropy and life is more complicated than the boy in the above cartoon implies. To understand these larger questions about Life, the Universe, and Everything, we need to first clarify what entropy is.\nThis post is about a variant of entropy—called cross-entropy—that I wrote about in a post on machine learning. There, I presented cross-entropy as a measure of the difference between two probability distributions. Most explanations of the concept, including its Wikipedia entry, mainly focus on its relevance in information theory, not physics.\nI learned in a talk by Sean Carroll during the Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Symposium that cross-entropy plays a central role in the informational reformulation of the Second Law. This way of thinking about entropy and the Second Law builds a fascinating bridge between machine learning and physics. Before we cross that bridge, let’s talk about plain old entropy.\nEntropy Without a Cross Entropy is one of the most important concepts in physics. It’s the main character of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system increases over time.\nDespite its importance, entropy is not as widely known or used as energy. Whether you’re trying to count your calories, arguing about the geopolitics of natural gas, or worrying about climate change, energy seems to be the main character. But it doesn’t quite make sense. We know that energy is conserved; all we do is transform energy from one form to another. Yet we sense that something is irreversibly lost when we “spend energy.” What exactly are we spending when we burn food or natural gas? Check out the next paragraph. The answer will surprise you!\nWell, it’s entropy. And its story starts with heat.\nThe Birth of Heat Thermodynamics is the study of heat, energy, and work. It was born in the 19th century during the Industrial Revolution from the desire to understand how to efficiently convert heat energy into mechanical work.\nSadi Carnot showed that the efficiency of a heat engine depends only on the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs and not on the specific working substance or the details of the engine design.1 While this observation had huge practical implications, his main contribution for our purposes is the distinction between reversible and irreversible processes, which led to the notion of entropy.\nThe term entropy was coined by the German physicist Rudolf Clausius in 1865 as a counterpart to the term energy. The 19th-century German intellectuals were enamored with neoclassical hellenism, which resulted in lots of Greek words in scientific literature. Entropia means “transformation to” in Greek. So the German word “Entropie” is the germanized Greek translation of the German word “Verwandlungsinhalt,” which Clausius used to describe the transformational content of energy.\nWhen you burn natural gas to generate heat, you spend the transformational content of the natural gas. The heat that results in this process cannot be transformed back; entropy increases. Clausius formulated the observation that heat flows naturally from a hot body to a cooler one through the inequality $$ dS ≥ \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}. $$ Clausius used $S$ for entropy in honor of Sadi Carnot, so $dS$ denotes a small change in entropy, $\\delta Q$ is the heat the system absorbs from its surroundings, and $T$ is the temperature at which the heat is absorbed. In an adiabatic process without heat exchange, we have $\\delta Q=0$, and entropy can never decrease in accordance with the Second Law.\nEntropy encapsulates the irreversible processes that we typically associate with energy usage. Concepts like energy crisis actually refer to entropy crisis: we need a continuous supply of low entropy to keep the world running.\nClausius’ inequality doesn’t give an origin story or an explanation for entropy. For that, we need statistical physics.\nAtoms The famous equality that describes entropy is engraved in Boltzmann’s tombstone2 $$ S = k \\log W. \\tag{1} \\label{1} $$ In this expression, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $W$ is the number of microstates corresponding to a particular macrostate of the system. To understand what $W$ represents, think of a system composed of many parts, say, tiny atoms. Our description of the system uses a few variables, such as heat and pressure. This macroscopic description is clearly underdetermined: there are gazillions of atomic configurations that result in a given value for heat and pressure.

We thus explore symmetric (exponential, Padé or Hermite) integrators, which are unconditionally stable and known to preserve certain Noether symmetries and phase-space volume.

We use a matricization technique to cast the mode-coupled system in a form amenable to a method-of-lines framework, which simplifies numerical implementation and enables efficient parallelization on CPU and GPU architectures.

The core of a machine learning algorithm is the neural network that maps inputs to desired outputs. When you read “neural network,” you might think of the human brain with layers of interconnected neurons working together to solve problems. But in machine learning, we are simply talking about a function with parameters. Lots and lots of parameters. “Learning” is adjusting these parameters until the difference between the desired output and the actual output of the function is sufficiently small. That’s it. In a way, machine learning is the rediscovery of the old adage that you can fit any elephant with sufficient parameters.\nThis was a very short summary of what people mean by machine learning. You can imagine that the function, the parameters, and the adjustment process are all rather sophisticated and can get very complicated. I’ll expand on this basic idea below with an example of a machine-learning algorithm.\nFirst, some terminology. Think of each input dimension as a neuron in a neural network. The parameters of the neural network, or the function, are called weights and biases. Weights represent the strength of the connection between neurons; biases shift the activation threshold of a neuron. By adjusting the weights and biases based on the output, the network learns the patterns in the data and makes predictions on new data.\nLet’s write this down. I mentioned that the neural network is just a function with parameters. Its output is usually a probability, so we’ll call it $p$. The network should look something like $p=f(x; W,b)$, where $x$ is the input array, $p$ is the network’s output array, $W$ are the weights, and $b$ are the biases. A simple neural network could then be written like this $$ p = W \\cdot x + b. $$ But wait, you say; this is just a linear transformation! Layering linear transformations on top of each other can only create a linear network. You can’t learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions with just linear transformations. To introduce nonlinearity into the model, we throw this into a nonlinear activation function $\\sigma$, so the output looks like $$ p = \\sigma(W \\cdot x + b). \\label{1} \\tag{1} $$ There are a few commonly used activation functions that one frequently encounters: the sigmoid function, the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, and so on. We’ll use a generalization of the sigmoid (or logistic) function for our experiments. $$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $$ This function maps a real-valued input to a value between 0 and 1, so the output can be interpreted as a probability, making it directly useful in classification problems.\nTo get into more detail, we need to understand and prepare the input. I use the MNIST dataset for the demonstration below. We will avoid the powerful machine learning packages and only use NumPy1, so all operations can be considered elemental. You can follow along on Colab. MNIST Dataset: Prepare the input The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image labeled with the correct digit, from 0 to 9. It’s commonly used for training and testing various image processing and machine learning algorithms. The digits in grayscale look like this Handwritten digits 0 and 1 from the MNIST dataset. Our goal is to teach the single-layer network (\\ref{1}) to recognize these handwritten digits. The network learns from the training dataset by adjusting its weights to minimize the difference between the desired output and the actual output, that is, the loss. This process is repeated until the loss is sufficiently small, implying that the network has learned the dataset. So we need to define the loss, calculate how it depends on layer parameters, and find a way to minimize it iteratively.\nLayer and Loss: Build the model Our model architecture consists of just the one layer in (\\ref{1}). So this is an example of shallow learning. But even with shallow networks, it can get confusing with the number of samples, inputs, and outputs. To recap, we have $M=60,000$ samples in the training set; each sample has $N=28\\times28=784$ dimensions (one for each pixel in a flattened 1D-array); the output has $K=$10 dimensions (one for each digit). Accounting is worse when you have hidden layers in between. They all live in different spaces, so it makes sense to introduce different types of letters into the tensor notation for each type of space. To clarify each space, I like to define indices with their own ranges2: $$ \\begin{align} a,b\u0026amp;=1,2,\\dots,M=60,000. \\\\ \\alpha, \\beta\u0026amp;=1,2,\\dots,N=784. \\\\ i,j\u0026amp;=1,2,\\dots,K=10. \\end{align} $$ We can then write the output of our AI algorithm as $$ p_{ai} = \\sigma(z_{ai}) = \\sigma\\left( \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N} x_{a\\alpha} W_{\\alpha i} + b_i \\right). \\tag{2} \\label{2} $$ Here, $\\sigma$ is a generalization of the sigmoid function, called the …","date":1670457660,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670457660,"objectID":"71f4ae963ccb66abcec46c8ab8481080","permalink":"https://anilzen.github.io/post/2022/learning-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2022-12-08T00:01:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022/learning-machine-learning/","section":"post","summary":"This is a short tutorial on machine learning.

Often, qualitative diagrams are sufficient if you’re mainly interested in the essential causal relationships. But sometimes, for numerical work or for your own understanding, you need a quantitatively correct diagram.\nBelow, we draw Penrose diagrams using free and open-source software. We’ll draw the diagrams using the LaTeX package TikZ (not a drawing program but a program that draws2). We’ll use Python to perform transformations when we hit the computational limitations of TikZ.\nThe code for all diagrams below is on my website repository. The basic idea behind Penrose diagrams The Penrose diagram is an extension, or better, a completion of the Minkowski diagram. Like in the Minkowski diagram, time is vertical, space is horizontal, and null rays are at 45 degrees to the axes. In contrast to the Minkowski diagram, a Penrose diagram includes “points at infinity” added by compactification, thereby visualizing the rich structure of infinity arising from the unification of space and time.\nBelow are two beautiful TikZ diagrams by Izaak Neutelings. On the left is the Minkowski diagram. Spacetime extends infinitely in all directions. On the right is the Penrose diagram representing the entire spacetime in a finite square.\nMinkowski diagram Penrose Diagram Compactification maps the Minkowski diagram to the Penrose diagram by mapping the null directions to a finite interval. Let’s see how that works.\nMinkowski spacetime Consider the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with standard spherical coordinates: $t \\in (-\\infty,\\infty)$, $r \\in [0,\\infty)$, $\\theta\\in[0,\\pi]$, $\\varphi\\in[0,2\\pi)$ with metric $$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\\sigma^2, $$ where $d\\sigma^2=d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2$. Penrose diagrams are two-dimensional, so we essentially ignore the angular coordinates represented by the $d\\sigma^2$ piece. Each point on the diagram, except the line at the origin, represents a sphere. Spherical light rays propagate along the directions $t+r$ and $t-r$. These directions are called null because they are in the nullspace of the metric.\nUnderlying the Penrose diagrams are coordinates, $T$ and $R$, which compactify these null directions: $$ T+R = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\arctan}(t+r),$$ $$ T-R = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\arctan}(t-r). $$ The scale factor $2/\\pi$ is to map the range of the coordinates to $T\\pm R \\in(-1,1)$. Note that I’m not including the endpoints in the intervals yet. The Penrose compactification procedure involves the conformal completion of the spacetime, which adds the points at infinity after a regularizing rescaling. This detail is not relevant for the diagrams but is important for geometry.\nThe Penrose coordinates $(T,R)$ read in terms of the standard $(t,r)$ as: $$ T(t,r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left( \\arctan(t+r) + \\arctan(t-r) \\right)$$ $$ R(t,r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left( \\arctan(t+r) - \\arctan(t-r) \\right)$$\nLet’s make some plots using these coordinates. I’ll demonstrate plotting time surfaces (level sets of a time coordinate). Say you’d like to draw constant $t$ surfaces in the Penrose diagram. You might be tempted to solve the above relationships for a graph function $T(R;t)$ with constant $t$. But it is easier to let the machine do the work and plot the surfaces parametrically. Define the functions $T(t,r)$ and $R(t,r)$ in TikZ as follows:\n\\tikzset{declare function={ T(\\t,\\r) = \\fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\\t+\\r) + atan(\\t-\\r))}; R(\\t,\\r) = \\fpeval{1/pi*(atan(\\t+\\r) - atan(\\t-\\r))}; }} Then, plot the lines parametrically.\n\\def\\Nlines{6} % total number of lines is 2\\Nlines+1 \\newcommand\\samp[1]{ tan(90*#1) } % for equidistant sampling \\foreach \\i [evaluate={\\t=\\i/(\\Nlines+1);}] in {-\\Nlines,...,\\Nlines}{ \\message{Drawing i=\\i...^^J} \\draw[line width=0.3,samples=30,smooth,variable=\\r,domain=0.001:1] plot({ R(\\samp{\\t},\\samp{\\r}) }, { T(\\samp{\\t},\\samp{\\r}) }); } We’re sampling points fairly evenly by incorporating the compactification into the plot function. As you can see in the diagrams below, the time surfaces are equally separated from each other at the origin. The function samp controls the separation of points in the plot.\nCompactification with arctan (file) Compactification with tanh (file) The two versions of the diagram illustrate a coordinate-dependent feature that confuses even the experts. The $t$ surfaces intersect at spatial infinity, $i^0$, on both diagrams. On the left, they are tangent to each other, while on the right, they are not. So this seems to be a coordinate-dependent feature. Penrose used the inverse tangent function in his original papers. Many other choices exist. For example, using the hyperbolic tangent, the mapping reads $$ T+R = \\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\tanh}(t+r),$$ $$ T-R = \\textcolor{DarkOrchid}{\\tanh}(t-r). $$ This mapping gives the diagram on the right where $t$ surfaces are not tangential at spatial infinity.

The source for the perturbations depends on the orbital configuration, calculational approach, and the order of the perturbative expansion. These sources fall into three broad classes: (i) distributional, (ii) worldtube, and (iii) unbounded support. The latter, in particular, is important for emerging second-order (in the mass ratio) calculations. Traditional frequency domain approaches employ the variation of parameters method and compute the perturbation on standard time slices with numerical boundary conditions supplied at finite radius from series expansions of the asymptotic behavior. This approach has been very successful, but the boundary conditions calculations are tedious, and the approach is not well suited to unbounded sources where homogeneous solutions must be computed at all radii. This work develops an alternative approach where hyperboloidal slices foliate the spacetime, and compactifying coordinates simplify the boundary treatment. We implement this approach with a multi-domain spectral solver with analytic mesh refinement and use the scalar-field self-force on circular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole as an example problem. The method works efficiently for all three source classes encountered in self-force calculations and has distinct advantages over the traditional approach. For example, our code efficiently computes the perturbation for orbits with extremely large orbital radii ($r_p\u003e10^5 M$) or modes with very high spherical harmonic mode index ($\\ell \\geq 100$). Our results indicate that hyperboloidal methods can play an essential role in self-force calculations.

Physicists are jealous of these fish drawn by M.C. Escher.

Escher was interested in constructing an infinitely repeating pattern in a finite figure. When the brilliant geometer Coxeter shared with him a reprint of one of his lectures on hyperbolic geometry, Escher figured out how to create such tessalations. The story of how Escher managed to create these four woodcuts is fascinating.\nThe original Quanta article in the tweet above reports the difficulties in constructing something like the AdS/CFT correspondence for physical spacetimes. While we have a realization of holographic duality based on anti-de Sitter spacetimes, a similar construction on flat or de Sitter spacetimes has been elusive, supposedly because these spacetimes do not possess hyperbolic geometry. A week after the tweet above, there was another Quanta article with hyperbolic geometry as its featured image. Clearly, there is some hype around hyperbolic geometry.\nThe main argument is that spatial slices of AdS are hyperbolic, which seems to be essential for AdS/CFT, so living in hyperbolic geometry makes it easier for the fish in Escher’s drawing to know quantum gravity.\nThe fish doesn’t think because the fish knows everything.\nKusturica (1993) from the movie Arizona Dream\nWe are, however, not like those fish; we want to discover quantum gravity. The obstacle remains that our physical models for spacetime are either asymptotically flat (for isolated systems) or de Sitter (for cosmology).\nI argue below that there is no need to be jealous of the fish. We do live in hyperbolic geometry; we just don’t know it yet.\nThere are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”\nWallace (2005) from his commencement speech This Is Water.\nLittle fish, big fish Let’s start with a short review of the hyperbolic fish in Escher’s drawing. Hyperbolic geometry is typically introduced in a fictitious higher dimensional Minkowski space using the equation for a hyperboloid in Cartesian coordinates. I’ll be using spherical coordinates foreshadowing an application below, so we have the Minkowski space with line element $$ ds^2_{\\rm{Mink}} = -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\\sigma^2,$$ where $d\\sigma^2=d\\sigma^2+\\sin^2\\theta \\ d\\varphi^2$, the usual metric on the unit sphere.\nSpheres and hyperboloids may seem very different, but they are analogous to each other. Just like the unit sphere is the set of points at unit Euclidean distance from the origin, the unit hyperboloid is the set of points at unit Minkowski distance from the origin: the hyperboloid is simply a (pseudo)sphere of Minkowski space $$t^2-r^2=1. \\tag{1} \\label{1}$$\nWe already have the first hint that we live in hyperbolic geometry! The hyperboloid describes the kinematic space of special relativity. But this was rather anticlimactic so let’s go a bit further.\nWe can derive and represent the intrinsic metric of hyperbolic geometry in various equivalent ways. For example, setting $t=\\cosh \\xi$ and $r=\\sinh \\xi$ satisfies the equation for the hyperboloid (\\ref{1}) identically, and gives us the hyperbolic line element $$ ds^2_{\\mathbb{H}^3} = d\\xi^2+ \\sinh^2\\xi \\ d\\sigma^2.$$ Note the similarity of this hyperbolic metric with the metric on the unit sphere. Coordinates are labels and it’s helpful to see hyperbolic geometry in different representations. Instead of introducing hyperbolic functions, let’s solve (\\ref{1}) directly $$ t = \\sqrt{1+r^2}. \\tag{2} \\label{2} $$ Replacing the $dt$ term with the differential of this relation in the Minkowski metric, we get $$ ds^2_{\\mathbb{H}^3} = \\textcolor{purple}{\\frac{1}{1+r^2}dr^2 + r^2 d\\sigma^2}. \\tag{3} \\label{3} $$\nTo get Escher’s image of a disk, we need to map the hyperboloid model with its infinite range in $r$ to the unit Poincaré disk model. We relabel the radial points using $$ r = \\frac{2\\rho}{1-\\rho^2}, \\tag{4}\\label{4}$$ and obtain the familiar line element for the Poincaré ball1 $$ ds^2_{\\mathbb{H}^3} = \\textcolor{darkorange}{\\frac{4}{(1-\\rho^2)^2}\\left( d\\rho^2 + \\rho^2 d\\sigma^2 \\right)}. $$ The metric blows up near the boundary, which is how Escher packs the infinitely many fish in a repeating pattern into the disk.

To me, the recognition that natural laws dynamically govern space and time was a triumph of physics over philosophy, of Einstein over Kant, of empirical determination over synthetic a priori.\nAs fascinated as I was by special relativity, the formalism seemed relatively obscure. I recognized patterns in the Lorentz transformations but missed a deeper insight into the origins of this structure. At college, I considered various standard derivations of relativistic effects, such as the relativistic aberration or the Thomas precession, tedious and boring.\nA simple example is Einstein’s velocity-addition formula. In Galilean relativity, which corresponds to our everyday experience, we can just add velocities. In special relativity, the speed of light is constant, so the addition of velocities must be such that no composition of velocities exceeds the speed of light. In the simplest case of collinear motion (velocities pointing in the same direction), velocity addition becomes speed addition and looks like this $$ \\tag{1} \\label{1} u = \\frac{u_1+u_2}{1+\\tfrac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}} $$ The speed of light, $c$, can never be exceeded with this composition law. While we can understand the result, it is not intuitively clear how this addition rule is related to the structure of space and time.\nIt turns out that relativistic calculations have natural interpretations in hyperbolic geometry. This viewpoint not only simplifies the calculations but also provides deeper insights into the theory. Its power extends beyond special relativity into machine learning and general relativity. And it all starts with Minkowski.\nHyperbole In 1908, Minkowski gave a lecture about a new mathematical model for space and time. In his opening remarks, he stated boldly that, from now on, space and time are mere shadows of a more fundamental union: spacetime.\nHenceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.\nMinkowski (1908)1\nThe quote is by now famous. It has made its way to various outlets since appearing on the cover page of Synge’s textbook on relativity in 1956. But when Minkowski made the statement, it was considered hyperbole and encountered resistance from physicists and mathematicians alike.2\nThe spacetime view became widely celebrated a few years after the lecture because of its central role in general relativity. In the same lecture, Minkowski also promoted a non-Euclidean approach to spacetime. As a Göttingen mathematics professor, he recognized the non-Euclidean geometry of special relativity. This idea, however, didn’t gain traction as widely as the idea of spacetime. Only in the last 20 years has there been renewed interest in the hyperbolic nature of special relativity.\nTo see why hyperbolic geometry is the natural geometry for special relativity, consider a two-dimensional spacetime with coordinates $(t,x)$ and Minkowski metric $$ ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2. $$ A natural object for a metric is the set of points at unit distance from the origin. In two-dimensional Euclidean space, we get a circle, $x^2+y^2=1$. In two-dimensional Minkowski space, we get a hyperbola\n$$ \\tag{2}\\label{2} t^2 - x^2 = 1. $$ Minkowski’s drawing below shows this hyperbola for $t\u0026gt;0$. In higher dimensions, you get the one-sheeted hyperboloid, also called hyperbolic hyperboloid.\nMinkowski’s drawing depicts hyperbola as the invariant space under Lorentz transformations. From Minkowski’s modern world by Scott Walter. In his lecture, Minkowski demonstrated that Lorentz transformations are hyperbolic rotations that leave the hyperbola (\\ref{2}) invariant. He died in January 1909 before he could develop this idea further, but it was embraced by a few other scientists, particularly by Sommerfeld, Varičak, Robb, and Borel.\nThe principle of relativity corresponds to the hypothesis that the kinematic space is a space of constant negative curvature, the space of Lobachevsky and Bolyai. The value of the radius of curvature is the speed of light.\nBorel (1913)\nThe mathematical formalism for a hyperbolic rotation is just like a regular rotation, except with hyperbolic functions instead of trigonometric functions. Hyperbolic functions are related to their trigonometric counterparts through complex angles. An intuitive way to think about the hyperbolic rotation is the squeeze mapping, which should be familiar to anyone who has seen a Lorentz transformation on a spacetime diagram.\nLorentz boosts are squeeze mappings.

Consider the Lorentz boost with relative speed $v$ between frames $$ L(v)= \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma \u0026amp; -\\gamma \\beta \\\\ -\\gamma \\beta \u0026amp; \\gamma \\end{pmatrix}, $$ where we defined the rescaled speed $\\beta:=\\tfrac{v}{c}$ and the Lorentz factor $\\gamma:=1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$.

To understand spacetime then, consider black holes.\nThe black holes of nature are the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time.\nChandrasekhar (1983)\nBlack holes are simple with just two properties: mass and rotation. By dropping an object into a black hole, you can increase its mass and change its rotation.\nThe simplicity of black holes contradicts the second law of thermodynamics, which states that total entropy never decreases. If black holes are that simple, you can reduce total entropy by dropping a high-entropy object, say a hot teacup, into the black hole.\nWheeler, best known for coining the term “black hole,” tasked one of his graduate students at Princeton, the young Bekenstein, with resolving this paradox. The golden age of relativity was in full swing around 1970, and Princeton was among the best places to be. Christodoulou, another student of Wheeler, and Hawking had just shown that the area of a black hole horizon never decreases. To resolve the entropy paradox, Bekenstein conjectured that black holes must have entropy and that the entropy must be proportional to the area of the black hole horizon in Planck units. The proportionality constant was determined by the discovery of Hawking temperature, which is why we call it the Bekenstein-Hawking Black-Hole entropy $$ S_{BH} = \\frac{A}{4 L_P^2}$$ where $A$ is the horizon area, $L_P$ is the Planck length, $S$ stands for entropy (probably after Sadi Carnot), and BH stands for Brief History.\nYou may think this is a curious result about curious objects called black holes with little relevance to our notion of spacetime. But consider the following question: what is the maximum entropy in a finite, say spherical region? If you take some high-entropy matter and squeeze it spherically (with your mind), eventually, you hit the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the compressed matter forms a black hole. This thought experiment leads to the surprising conclusion that the entropy of any matter system is bound by the surface area of the smallest sphere that encloses it1.\nWe started with black holes and arrived at the\nHolographic Principle Counterintuitively, the maximal entropy of a region scales with the area of its boundary, not its volume. The holographic principle pushes this area-dependence further, suggesting that the dynamics in a volume of space is encoded on the boundary of that space. In other words, the information content of a spacetime region is encoded on the surface of that region.\nTake a break and think about this for a moment. How can our three-dimensional world be encoded on a two-dimensional surface? What does it mean? Is the universe a game running on the screen of an alien child? Are we trapped in The Matrix? Are we Livin’ on the Edge?\nAerosmith: Livin’ on the Edge (Video 1993) AdS/CFT correspondence The most famous realization of the holographic principle is the AdS/CFT correspondence. Conjectured by Maldacena in 1997, the correspondence suggests an equivalence between a string theory in curved anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS) and a strongly coupled conformal field theory in a lower-dimensional flat spacetime. Aside from the details, the remarkable aspect of the conjecture is the duality between the bulk and the boundary of AdS.\nBelow is a visual image for the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. The cylinder represents the three-dimensional AdS$_3$ spacetime. On the boundary of the cylinder lives the 1+1 dimensional CFT$_2$. Slices of constant time are hyperbolic manifolds with negative curvature, drawn as Poincaré disks. A gravity theory within the disks is dual to a gravity-free theory on the bounding circle. The boundary of space encodes the bulk.\nAdS is hyperbolic space with a time direction. Wikimedia The negative curvature of AdS is a feature and a bug. It allows the realization of the holographic principle due to its hyperbolic slices, but it also makes AdS an unphysical model for our universe. At cosmological scales, the universe has positive curvature and resembles de Sitter space. At astrophysical and smaller scales, isolated systems are modeled by asymptotically flat spacetimes. Either way, anti-de Sitter spacetime, with all its bizarre features, is not a good model for physical reality.\nCan we establish the holographic principle for isolated systems?\nHyperbolic Hyperboloidal Consider the AdS$_3$ metric in static coordinates with curvature scale $L$ $$ ds^2_{\\rm{AdS}} = - \\left(L^2+r^2\\right) d\\tau^2 + \\textcolor{RedViolet}{\\frac{L^2}{L^2+r^2} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2},$$ Slices of constant time are hyperbolic spaces with negative curvature.

When presenting my work, I often encounter the objection that infinity is not physical. But not all infinities are created equal, and some are more physical than others. In fact, we can verify by experiment that we are at infinity with respect to distant sources of radiation.\nBelow I collect some thoughts on infinity and describe the experiment. Feel free to skip my ramblings and go directly to the experiment.\nWe don’t need no infinity Physicists are generally uncomfortable with infinity. First, it is argued, infinity cannot be the outcome of a physical experiment. Second, infinity as the outcome of a calculation indicates problems with the theory. Resolving such problems is important because they may reveal new research directions such as renormalization techniques. Since infinity doesn’t make sense in experiment and should be avoided in theory, physicists are skeptical when it appears in mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena. A few examples: Max Tegmark argues that infinity is an idea that should be retired from physics; Nicolas Gisin aims to understand time without relying on infinitely precise numbers; and here is a quote from The physics of infinity by Ellis, Meissner, and Nicolai:\nWe maintain that in each physical case where $\\infty$ is used in a discussion, greater insight is attained by considering what large number $N$ will suffice instead because real physics is embodied in that number.\nThis uneasiness of physicists with infinity is also present in mathematics. There are mathematical philosophies and formalisms without infinity, such as finitism or intuitionism. I was attracted to similar ideas when I was in college, so I went down the rabbit hole of fuzzy numbers. They seemed to “naturally” represent physical measurements, which are not real numbers with infinite precision but fuzzy numbers with uncertainties. The more I learned about fuzzy numbers, however, the less I was convinced of their general utility. They were cumbersome and did not improve calculations in most cases. I learned, by way of fuzzy numbers, that successful mathematical representations do not necessarily match our physical intuitions. The map is not the territory.\nEmpirical infinity Aristotle distinguishes two notions of infinity: actual and potential. Potential infinity is what children learn first: numbers just keep going “forever”. Actual infinity is the completion of this process: the set of all numbers as a mathematical object.\nWe do not observe infinity directly but we use it to represent our impressions of the natural world. In a painting, both sides of a road may meet at a vanishing point. The road ends somewhere but the painting suggests that the meeting point is beyond the horizon of perception. The representation of “far” on the canvas is infinity.\nThe infinity on the canvas is neither potential (it’s a finite, completed representation of infinity) nor actual (the horizon is actually at a finite distance). Call it empirical infinity. Empirical concepts are abstracted from individual perceptions. Empirical infinity is the best canvas representation of your perception looking down a long, seemingly unending road. You don’t know how far you can see, and you don’t care about representing that particular detail in your painting. You just want to express that it’s very far.\nA thought experiment Black hole perturbations have a property that is different at infinity and at a finite distance. We can use this property to determine where we are with respect to the black hole. We would need very accurate detectors to measure it, which we don’t have yet, so consider this a reasonable thought experiment.\nPerturbations of a black hole go through an oscillatory period, and subsequently decay with a power-law $ \\sim t^p$, where $t$ is time as measured by the observer and $p$ is the negative power1. Surprisingly, the power $p$ is different depending on where you observe the perturbations: -3 at finite distances, -2 at infinity2. The slower decay at infinity is somewhat unexpected. One could argue that the power-law decay, which was first discovered for finite distances, should be non-radiative; it shouldn’t even be detected at infinity. As demonstrated by Gundlach, Price, and Pullin in 1994, it is not only radiative but decays slower at infinity than at finite distances3. There are explanations of this slower decay in terms of accumulation of backscattering off of curvature towards infinity, but this is not our main concern4. Given that the rates at finite distances and infinity are different, we ask the following question:\nWhich decay rate would we observe?\nWe are clearly a finite distance away from the black hole, so the intuitive answer is that we would measure the finite distance rate. However, the correct answer is the infinity rate.\nBelow is a figure from a paper of mine where I studied various decay rates.

For certain merger configurations the time evolution of the magnitude of the kick velocity has a local maximum followed by a sudden drop. Perturbative studies of this “antikick” in a limited range of black hole spins have found that the antikick decreases for retrograde orbits as a function of negative spin. We analyze this problem using a recently developed code to evolve gravitational perturbations from a point particle in Kerr spacetime driven by an effective-one-body resummed radiation reaction force at linear order in the mass ratio $ν≪1$. Extending previous studies to nearly extremal negative spins, thus complementing current numerical relativity knowledge about the recoil, we find that the well-known decrease of the antikick is overturned and, instead of approaching zero, the antikick increases again to reach $Δv/(cν^2)=3.37×10^{−3}$ for dimensionless spin $\\hat{a}=−0.9999$. The corresponding final kick velocity is $v_{end}/(cν^2)=0.076$. We interpret the antikick result analytically by means of the quality factor $Q$ of the linear momentum flux, that is used to quantify the amount of nonadiabaticity of the emission process.

This paper explores an alternative to the traditional approach, namely, the construction of template banks directly from numerical BBH simulations. Using nonspinning BBH systems as an example, we demonstrate which regions of the mass-parameter plane can be covered with existing numerical BBH waveforms. We estimate the required number and required length of BBH simulations to cover the entire nonspinning BBH parameter plane up to mass ratio 10, thus illustrating that our approach can be used to guide parameter placement of future numerical simulations. We derive error bounds which are independent of analytical waveform models; therefore, our formalism can be used to independently test the accuracy of such waveform models.

We demonstrate the trapping of energy near the photon sphere and confirm its exponential decay. The trapped wavefront passes through caustics resulting in echoes that propagate to infinity. The arrival times and the decay rate of these caustic echoes are consistent with propagation along null geodesics and the large $\\ell$ limit of quasinormal modes. We show that the fourfold singularity structure of the retarded Green function is due to the well-known action of a Hilbert transform on the trapped wavefront at caustics. A twofold cycle is obtained for degenerate source-observer configurations along the caustic line, where the energy amplification increases with an inverse power of the scale of the source. Finally, we discuss the tail piece of the solution due to propagation within the light cone, up to and including null infinity, and argue that, even with ideal instruments, only a finite number of echoes can be observed. Putting these pieces together, we provide a heuristic expression that approximates the Green function with a few free parameters.

The conformal compactification technique enables us to calculate spatially unbounded domains, thereby avoiding the introduction of an artificial timelike outer boundary. We construct in spherical symmetry an explicit scri-fixing gauge, ie a conformal and a coordinate gauge in which the spatial coordinate location of null infinity is independent of time so that no resolution loss in the physical part of the conformal extension appears. Going beyond spherical symmetry, we develop a method to include null infinity in the computational domain. With this method, hyperboloidal initial value problems for the Einstein equations can be solved in a scri-fixing general wave gauge. To study spatial infinity, we discuss the conformal Gauss gauge and the reduced general conformal field equations from a numerical point of view. This leads us to the first numerical calculation of the entire Schwarzschild-Kruskal solution including spatial, null and timelike infinity and the domain close to the singularity. After developing a three dimensional, frame based evolution code with smooth inner and outer boundaries we calculate a radiative axisymmetric vacuum solution in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity represented as a cylinder including a piece of null infinity.
