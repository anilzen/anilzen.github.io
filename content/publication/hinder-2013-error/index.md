abstract: The Numerical–Relativity–Analytical–Relativity (NRAR) collaboration is a
  joint effort between members of the numerical relativity, analytical relativity
  and gravitational-wave data analysis communities. The goal of the NRAR collaboration
  is to produce numerical-relativity simulations of compact binaries and use them
  to develop accurate analytical templates for the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration to use
  in detecting gravitational-wave signals and extracting astrophysical information
  from them. We describe the results of the first stage of the NRAR project, which
  focused on producing an initial set of numerical waveforms from binary black holes
  with moderate mass ratios and spins, as well as one non-spinning binary configuration
  which has a mass ratio of 10. All of the numerical waveforms are analysed in a uniform
  and consistent manner, with numerical errors evaluated using an analysis code created
  by members of the …
