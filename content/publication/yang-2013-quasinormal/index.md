abstract: We provide an in-depth investigation of quasinormal-mode oscillations of
  Kerr black holes with nearly extremal angular momenta. We first discuss in greater
  detail the two distinct types of quasinormal-mode frequencies presented in a recent
  paper [H. Yang et al., Phys. Rev. D 87, 041502 (2013)]. One set of modes that we
  call “zero-damping modes” has vanishing imaginary part in the extremal limit and
  exists for all corotating perturbations (ie modes with azimuthal index m≥ 0). The
  other set (the “damped modes”) retains a finite decay rate even for extremal Kerr
  black holes and exists only for a subset of corotating modes. As the angular momentum
  approaches its extremal value, the frequency spectrum bifurcates into these two
  distinct branches when both types of modes are present. We discuss the physical
  reason for the mode branching by developing and using a bound-state formulation
  for the perturbations of …
