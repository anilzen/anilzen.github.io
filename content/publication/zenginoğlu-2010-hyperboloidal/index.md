abstract: We present the numerical implementation of a clean solution to the outer
  boundary and radiation extraction problems within the 3+ 1 formalism for hyperbolic
  partial differential equations on a given background. Our approach is based on compactification
  at null infinity in hyperboloidal scri fixing coordinates. We report numerical tests
  for the particular example of a scalar wave equation on Minkowski and Schwarzschild
  backgrounds. We address issues related to the implementation of the hyperboloidal
  approach for the Einstein equations, such as nonlinear source functions, matching,
  and evaluation of formally singular terms at null infinity.
