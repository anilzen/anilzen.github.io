abstract: We discuss the hyperboloidal evolution problem in general relativity from
  a numerical perspective, and present some new results. Families of initial data
  which are the hyperboloidal analogue of Brill waves are constructed numerically,
  and a systematic search for apparent horizons is performed. Schwarzschild‐Kruskal
  spacetime is discussed as a first application of Friedrich’s general conformal field
  equations in spherical symmetry, and the Maxwell equations are discussed on a nontrivial
  background as a toy model for continuum instabilities.
