abstract: The detection of gravitational waves and the extraction of physical information
  from them requires the prediction of accurate waveforms to be used in template banks.
  For that purpose, the accuracy of effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms has been improved
  over the last years by calibrating them to numerical-relativity (NR) waveforms.
  So far, the calibration has employed a handful of NR waveforms with a total length
  of∼ 30 cycles, the length being limited by the computational cost of NR simulations.
  Here, we address the outstanding problem of the stability of the EOB calibration
  with respect to the length of NR waveforms. Performing calibration studies against
  NR waveforms of nonspinning black-hole binaries with mass ratios 1, 1.5, 5 and 8,
  and with a total length of∼ 60 cycles, we find that EOB waveforms calibrated against
  either 30 or 60 cycles will be indistinguishable by the advanced detectors Laser
