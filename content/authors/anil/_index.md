I'm a researcher and administrator at the [Institute for Physical Science & Technology](https://ipst.umd.edu), [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu). Here, you'll find information about my [research](publication/) and [thoughts](post/). 

My [research](publication/) is about numerical computations of waves in infinite domains. Much of my work concerns gravitational waves, but I also apply relativistic methods to nonrelativistic problems. Lately, I've been interested in hyperbolic geometry as it appears in many areas of science, such as special relativity, black holes, quantum gravity, machine learning, biology, number theory, and oceanography. 

I regard science administration as the highest form of public service. <!-- and enjoy bringing researchers together in thematically focused but geographically distributed networks --> My administrative work started in 2014 with an NSF-funded research network on kinetic theory called [Ki-Net](https://www.ki-net.umd.edu/). Throughout my administrative journey, I took on various roles such as Coordinator, Community Manager, IT Manager, Acting Business Director, and Graduate Program Manager. Currently, I serve the [Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Hub](https://qtd-hub.umd.edu), the [Biophysics](https://ipst.umd.edu/graduate-programs/biophysics) and [Chemical Physics](https://ipst.umd.edu/graduate-programs/chemical-physics) Graduate Programs, and the [Burgers Program in Fluid Dynamics](https://ipst.umd.edu/research/burgers).

<!-- the [Data Science Education Community of Practice](https://dsecop.org)
I served at the [University Senate](https://www.senate.umd.edu/)
the research program for undergraduates [TREND](https://ireap.umd.edu/trend) -->
